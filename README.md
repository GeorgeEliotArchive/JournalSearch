 This code pulls the most recent .csv file from the Omeka journals collection and doesn't a simple search based on a keyword, phrase, or date. 

 The URL used was pulled from the Omeka site search function with filtering to display only 'Journal Entry' items. 

 Pressing search button or return (enter) key will trigger a search. 

 When a keyword or phrase is searched, entries are limited to 3 sentences before and after the keyword or phrase for brevity sake.

 When a date is searched YYYY or MM-DD-YYYY, the full journal entry is displayed. 


 Outstanding Items:
