Diary 1954-1861,1854-07-22,15-16,40-41,N/A,"22nd. We went to the Museum and saw Rubens's Crucifixion, even more
beautiful to me than the Descent from the Cross. These two pictures profoundly impressed me with the miserable lack of breadth and grandeur in the conceptions of our living artists. The reverence for the old masters is not all humbug and superstition. At the Church of St. Paul we saw some marvellous wood carving by Verbruggen. For roundness, grace and expression I have rarely seen anything equal to it even in marble. On the outside of this church, there is an elaborate representation of Calvary- puerile, like the faith it embodies, but impressive, like everything else that attempts -even if it only attempts - to make the past vividly present. At the church of St.Jacques we saw the famous altar-piece - a Holy Family presenting portraits ofRubens, his two wives, and his Father (as Time). At the Museum, we were rather disappointed in the bull's head (in the adoration of the Magi) so much lauded by Ruskin. He dwells on the simplicity of the means by which Rubens has here produced so striking an effect - the few bold dashes of the brush by which the head is made to stand out with such reality in the picture. But on examination the texture does not appear so slight as he leads one to expect. A picture of Card-players by Valentin was the only thing that delighted us here, besides the Crucifixion. We took our coffee in
the Café Français and spent our evening in listening to an excellent band which was serenading the Governor on the occasion ofhis being knighted."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-07-23,16,41,N/A,"23. Sunday. We were grilled in the Railway carriage this morning on our way to Brussels, and glad to find ourselves havened in the comfortable Hotel de Belgique, kept by a Mlle van Stockeran. On walking out in the evening we were struck with the palatial appearance of the Haute Ville, especially in the Rue Royale, and around the Park. Standing against the statue of the Comte de Belliard, we saw the sun set behind the spire of the Hotel de Ville - a spire which reminded me of Scott's monument at Edinburgh . Then we went to a concert in the Park, and en joyed seeing the people looking cheerful at their little tables with their glass oflemonade or sirop, or their cup of coffee."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-07-24,16,41,N/A,"24. We rambled about the town from breakfast till 1. St. Gudule, the principal church, is very magnificent. The front is a fine specimen of Gothic and the interior, which is very carefully and tastefully kept is rich in fine effects of painted glass, seen through labyrinthine arches. Orange trees are ranged along each side of the nave. We found the Basse Ville very picturesque - the Grand Place where stands the Hotel de Ville especially fine. A gallery or arcade of shops - La galérie de la Reine- is remarkably elegant. We strolled into the Marché aux Fleurs and there bought some cheap French novels. Our aching legs and melting bodies at last reached the Pare, where we rested under the shade a little while and then came home to dinner. A cavalry officer is the only other inmate of our hotel. In the evening we walked to the Zoological Gardens flattering ourselves that we were going to hear a concert by the band of the ""Guides""; but we were only just in time to see them quit the orchestra. However we had a pretty view of houses, trees and water from the gardens, and were consoled for our disappointment by the pleasure we had in strolling through the Basse Ville by starlight. The smells in the streets are sickening."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-07-25&26,16,41,N/A,"25 and 26. Short rambles in the morning, lying melting on our beds through the middle of the day, and our one evening resort, the concert in the Park filled up these two days. We saw the famous Mannikin and took chocolate at the Cafe aux Milles Colonnes; went to the Messageries to inquire about our luggage with
no other result than a colloquy with a hideous, uncivil man installed there as
chief functionary."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-07-27,16-17,41-42,N/A,"27 Thursday. We rose at sand set off for Namur. Our companions in the 2nd class carriage were some disgustingly coarse Belgians with baboonish children. Passed a train full of soldiers who set up a hideous howl, meant for singing. Every attempt at vocal music which we have happened to hear in Belgium has been of the same sort. When we reached Namur, it still rained a little, but after we had dined we managed to take a survey of the town, and to walk up a hill close to the fortifications from which we had a pleasant view suggestive of quiet industry. Our railway journey along the Meuse served to show us how much beauty there is on its banks, but was too rapid to allow of our enjoying it. The saloon, with its sofas and glass sides is a perfect contrivance. About s we reached the Hotel de l'Europe at Liege and had our tea in my bedroom, from the window of which there is an enchanting view of rich and varied foliage flanked by stately heights covered with buildings. We spent the evening in walking about Liege and were in a state of rapture at its beauty-entirely unlike anything we had seen before. The rich green everywhere breaking the lines of the picturesque houses, the amphitheatre of richly wooded hills which surround the valley of the Meuse and of which one catches sight here and there at the end of a street, the fine Boulevard leading to the river-everything we saw was beautiful. We determined to stay here through Friday and defer our departure for Cologne until Saturday morning."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-07-28,17,42,N/A,"28. We went the first thing to the Church of St. Jacques - perhaps the finest thing we have seen on our journey. Forms, proportions, colouring-all is harmony, and we sat for half an hour wrapt in delicious contemplation. The delicate cream colour of the stone has an effect almost equal to that of marble in beauty- perhaps quite equal in its way. We came here again in the evening to hear the organ, but the Belgian voices which accompanied it or rather overpowered it prevented us from getting much extra enjoyment out of the music. The church warden's wife told us that some English artists had been engaged for 4 years in this church and had produced a thick quarto volume of drawings from it. Next to this delight came the Palais de Justice, formerly the palace of the Prince Bishop. The interior court with its colonnade of elaborately sculptured arches in grey stone is unique in my experience. One side has been restored and shews in perfection the varied patterns of the columns. We had a drive in an open carriage through the town to the Casino, a charming place with heights from which we had a fine view of Liege and its environs. On returning we saw the statue of Gretry. In the evening after going to St.Jacques we had another drive and then a farewell walk to our beloved Palais de Justice and to the Quay."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-07-29,17-18,42-43,N/A,"29. We set off by the 9 o'clock train for Cologne. The country from Liege to Vervier was striking} y beautiful. At Vervier Dr. Brabant joined us in our
carriage. Cologne looked very dismal as we passed through it in the omnibus on our way to the Hotel de Holland e. After dinner Dr. Brabant called to tell us that Strauss was residing in Cologne and would receive us the next morning at 9. We went with Dr. B. to see the Cathedral. When I entered itthe sight of the ugly wall which shuts out the choir - the proper vista of the nave, shocked me as one would be shocked by an ugly wooden arm attached to an exquisite marble torso. In the evening we had a ramble through the town, which looked more endurable by the soft evening light- but its grand characteristics are the multitude of churches and the multiplicity of smells . On our return we found
Dr. Brabant who came to tell us that Strauss would call on us in the morning."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-07-30,18,43,N/A,"30 Sunday. We breakfasted in the public room and were joined there by Dr. B. and Strauss. After a short interview with them we went on board the steamboat which was to take us to Coblentz. I did not expect much pleasure from [the) Rhine, so I took all that came with a good grace. In Coblentz I was rather disappointed, but it had still much beauty for me. The affectionate manners of
the waiter at the hotel (Trois Suisses) were amusing. The view from the bridge over the Moselle was a fine picture. So was that from our hotel windows looking on Ehrenbreitstein and the bridge ofboats. We remarked the great number of deformed people here. In one short evening walk we met 10 or 12 of them."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-07-31,18,43,N/A,"31. We set out again by the boat at 8 this morning, and had a delightful voyage. The banks of the Rhine from Coblentz to Mainz surpassed my expectations and seemed to me really to deserve Byron's praise. I fancy we saw the vines at the right moment- their green was so vivid. When they begin to turn yellow they must look rather forlorn, but the feathery hanging woods which clothe the hills here and there would shew best in Autumn. When we landed at Mainz, it began to rain, but we were brave enough to set out on a walk through the town, and were rewarded by a sight of the Nassau soldiery exercising- richer than any caricature in Punch. We were fairly driven back to the station by the rain and the smells, so we sat quietly awaiting the time of starting by the train to Frankfurt admiring the prim architectural looking bouquets on the table of the waiting room and getting by heart the German faces about us. In the same carriage with us were a Prussian Graf, who carried a loaf of black bread on his lap and talked to every one with great bonhomie, a Dutchman, and an Austrian with his wife. They talked, like every one else of the Turks and Russians. The Dutchman declared with great emphasis that England was much less beloved by Germany than Russia because she (England) was a more formidable rival in trade! -After a 'mauvais moment' waiting for our luggage we got into the omnibus and were carried to the Weidenbusch near the Rossmarkt, a very comfortable hotel."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-08-01,18,43,N/A,"Aug. 1. Tuesday. The first thing we did this morning was to go and see Goethe's statue by Schwanthaler and then his home in the Hirschgraben. Next we walked to the Judengasse; a striking scene! Next to the Staedel Museum, where the one thing never to be forgotten was Hübner's picture ofJob and his friends. Lessing's pictures - Ezzelin in prison and Huss before the Council of Constance - are meritorious but not thrilling. We unfortunately missed Overbeck's picture of Christianity triumphing over the Arts. We filled up our minutes before dinner by a second visit to Goethe's house, and a drive to the Bibliothek where we saw Marchesi's statue of Goethe and the portraits of Luther and his wife. In the evening we went to the Main Lust and heard some agreeable music."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-08-02,18-19,43-44,N/A,"2. Heavy and continuous rain kept us in our hotel till it was time to see
Dannecker's Ariadne. It stands in a pavilion in the garden ofHerr Bethmann, a wealthy banker. I never saw any sculpture equal to this - the feeling it excites is the essence of true worship- a bowing of the soul before power creating beauty. At 5 o'clock we set out on our 10 hours' journey to Weimar. The second class carriage was so comfortable, and the weather so lovely after the morning rains that the first half of our journey was delightful instead of fatiguing. The splendid view we had of Marburg by the setting sun was worth the whole journey. we got a little tired and leg-achy before we reached Weimar at 1/2 past 3, but after a little difficulty we got some tolerable beds at the Erbprinz and slept away our fatigue by 9 o'clock."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-08-03,19,44,N/A,"3rd. It was very pretty to look out of the window, when dressing, on a garden that reminded one of an English Village. Our walk in search oflodgings made us acquainted with the physiognomy of the town, which is more like a huge village or market town than the precinct of a court. We soon obtained some lodgings and here we are at 62a Kaufgasse at the house of Frau Mtinderloh, on the whole as comfortable as need be. In the evening we walked to Ober Weimarto see ""Der Posse als Medicin"" at the ""Tivoli Theater"", a little wooden structure in a garden."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-08-04,19,44,N/A,"4. We took possession of our lodgings this morning and had enough to do
before dinner in arranging our books etc. We pay 9 thalers per month for our lodgings. Our dinner at the Erbprinz is 12 1/2 groschen = about 15d. In the evening we happened, in our walk, to find the Erholung, where a concert was going forward. The walks in the garden are beautifully arched over with treesfirs chiefly which with their falling leaves make a matting that deadens the sound of one's footsteps - a great charm to me. We sat down among the company, made up almost entirely of women, most of them good-looking well dressed bourgeoises, chatting with an air of real friendliness over their knitting etc. When we came home I read some of L.'s M.S. aloud."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-08-05,19,44,N/A,"5 Sat. We read, wrote and walked a little before dinner. After, I read Sainte Beuve aloud. A letter from Mr. Chapman, proposing to me to write an article on Victor Cousin's Mde. de Sable. We ordered the book at the ""Hof-Buchhandlung"", a modest shop in the Markt Platz. In the evening we walked to Tiefurt, and were delighted with the grounds there."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-08-06,19,44,N/A,"6 Sunday. We wrote our letters and then walked out. Saw the outside of
Goethe's house in the Frauen Place. Dined for the first time at the Russischer Hof. Linenless, German. Our evening walk was to Belvedere, an enchanting place. A rumbling awkward carriage pronounced to be ""ein hübscher Wagen""."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-08-07,19,44,N/A,"7 Monday. Rainy. A pleasant walk in the Pare, notwithstanding. Read M.S. in the evening."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-08-08,19,44,N/A,"8 Tuesday. L. called on Scholl, and in the afternoon he (Scholl) came and took us to the Schloss where we saw the Dichter Zimmer."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-08-09,21,46,N/A,"Wednesday 9. We went to the little Tivoli Theatre and saw a ""star"" in Kotzebue's play - Der Arme Poet and Numero 726 a farce known in England as ""The Lottery Ticket."" In the morning L. called on Liszt."

Diary 1954-1861,1854-08-11,22,47,N/A,"Friday 11. We went to the Bibliothek with Hofrath Schöll, and looked at the
portraits and busts. The most remarkable among them is one in bronze of Gluck. The rugged power of the face is given with wonderful reality, as far as possible from the feeble idealization one generally sees in busts. There is a bust of Goethe, taken during his stay in Italy, which represents him as an Apollo. It is exquisitely beautiful but I cannot believe the brow to be accurate. Lessing's head and face are small, but of a fine, delicate type. Jacobi is rather feeble looking. We walked about with Schöll till it began to rain and then sought shelter with him under a door place. He is a genial unaffected man, full of accurate knowledge on all literary and philosophical subjects, and there is no German heaviness either in his appearance or his mind. In the morning L. called on Frau von Goethe."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-08-12,22,47,N/A,"12 Saturday. The morning being bright, we went to spend our day at Belvedere, the Grand Duke's Summer residence. It stands on the most considerable elevation in the immediate neighbourhood of Weimar, and is surrounded with lovely gardens which one enjoys all the more because they are free to all the good people of the town. The road to Belvedere is remarkable. It is one long avenue of stately trees. Just as we were going to leave, afters or 6 hours of quiet happiness, we met Schöll and turned back with him. He was presently joined by his wife whom we saw for the first time."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-08-[13],23,48,N/A,"12 [13] Sunday. Another glorious morning! But L.'s head is bad, and that makes us melancholy. We called on the Princess and strolled till dinner. Finished Cousin's book on Madame de Sable. In the evening we walked to Ober Weimar and satisfied ourselves that the village was very ugly."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-08-[14],23,48,N/A,"13 [14]. We devoted the day to an expedition to Ettersburg. On our return homewards the solemn grandeur of the Pine forest, in contrast with the sunbathed woods through which we had been passing, had a strong effect on us. The Chaussee has a bordering of cherry trees and mountain ashes. The
bunches of coral berries gladdened our eyes."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-08-[15],23,48,N/A,"14 [15] Tuesday. We had our names set down for the Table d'hôte at the
Erbprinz, by which means our dinners will only cost us 10 silver groschen each. Our expenses here, including wine and washing are £2.6 per week. Liszt called and sat chatting for an hour with me."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-08-[16],23,48,N/A,15 [16] Wednesday. I wrote to my sister and to Mr. Bray.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-08-[17],23,48,N/A,16 [17] Thursday. Liszt dined with us at the Erbprinz and came home with us to take coffee. Much pleasant chat. Afterwards L. and I walked to Belvedere.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-08-[18],23,48,N/A,17 [18] Friday. Nothing particular.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-08-[19],23,48,N/A,18 [19] Sat. Letter from Miss Parkes. Not well.

Diary 1954-1861,1854-08-[21],23,48,N/A,20 [21]. Bad headache. Scholl called in the afternoon.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-08-[22],23,48,N/A,21 [22]. Head still bad. Walked to Belvedere and saw the Theatre in the garden.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-08-[23],23,48,N/A,22 [23] Wed. Better. Wrote a little. Invited to Liszt's but did not go. Went to the Vogel-schiessenin the evening and saw Punch etc.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-08-24,23,48,N/A,"24. Wrote all morning. Afternoon, went to Schiller's house. Stupidity of people tricking out and altering such a place instead ofletting one see it as he saw it and lived in it. I played on his little claveçin, in which lay his guitar; Vogel-schiessen, Punch."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-08-25,23,48,N/A,25. Goethe's House. Study and Bedroom.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-08-30,23,48,N/A,"30. Arthur Helps came yesterday to Weimar on his way to Dresden. L was with him all morning. He took coffee with us after dinner. In the evening we drove to Ettersburg, and he entertained us with charming stories about his Spanish travels."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-02,23,48,N/A,"Sep. 2. Saturday. I went with G. to Bercka for the first time. A little Elysium and the way to it very lovely. We dined al fresco in the presence of a pretty little meadow scene with holy oaks in the foreground. In returning, the evening was enchanting."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-03,23,48,N/A,"3 Sunday. Bad headache and unable to work. In the evening we went to Belvedere, and I saw several parts of the garden which were new to me."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-04,24,49,N/A,4. Mr Chapman's letter came to say that my article must be ready in London by the 10th.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-08,24,49,N/A,8. Sent off my article on Mme. de Sable. Went to Tiefurt in the evening.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-09,24,49,N/A,9. We went to Belvedere and spent the day there. Wrote Mr. Chapman.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-10,24,49,N/A,"10 Sunday. Wrote to Miss Parkes. Then we walked out in the fields towards Gelmeroda and sat in the sunshine. In the evening, to a party at Liszt's - Herrmann's conjuring the chief amusement. Medallion ofLiszt by Rietschl very fine."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-11,24,49,N/A,"11. Walked in the Webicht, and talked of art. In the afternoon we went to Jena. Much struck by the scenery. Slept at the Sonne."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-12,24,49,N/A,"12. Saw Goethe's rooms at the Tanne, now occupied by Dr. Widmann and his
wife, a niece of Neander's. We then walked up the Hausberg, and had an
enchanting view of the little village of Lichtenhain, nestled among trees in a lovely valley. The winding walk among the pines and firs, the wild flowers, the delicious air and the unclouded sky were intoxicating. The town of Jena is unmitigatedly dull and ugly, but Nature around it is enough to reconcile one to being there a short time. As we sat on the side of the hill, in ascending, the town looked very pretty and we heard scarcely a sound except the music of a band at various distances. We came home by a Wagen which started from the Sonne at 4. I was amazed at the beauty of the road, which I had not seen well as we went, from being shut up in a close Wagen. The evening sky was beautiful and we had full leisure to observe it, for we did not reach Weimar till 1/2 past 7. The little town looked more bright and cheety than ever after Jena."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-13,24,49,N/A,13 Wednesday. I was not at all well and overwalked myself by going to Belvedere in the evening. The Scholls and Sauppes were there.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-14,24,49,N/A,"14. Very unwell this morning, and glad in the afternoon to hear that Liszt
wished to put off our going to him. We had a delicious walk in the open fields, came home, and finished the M. S. of Goethe's life."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-16,24,49,N/A,16 Saturday. We went to the Weimar Theatre for the first time and heard Ernani.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-17,24,49,N/A,17. We deferred going to Ilmenau and passed the day quietly
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-18,24,49,N/A,"18. Liszt came to dine with us at the Erbprinz and introduced M. Rubinstein, a young Russian, who is about to have an opera of his performed here."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-19,24,49,N/A,"19 Tuesday. We went to an evening party at Liszt's and heard the instrument, half organ, half piano, which he has had constructed for himself."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-20,24-25,49-50,N/A,"20. We set off for Ilmenau by railway. I read Liszt's account of""Der Fliegende
Hollander"" by the way. When we reached Neu Dietendorf, we had to get into the Post Wagen which turned out to be a disagreeable omnibus-like vehicle. At Arnstadt we were placed in a Beiwagen with two other passengers and had a pleasant view of the charming country all the way to Ilmenau. But the jolting vehicles and other désagréments had made us both ill and we could only crawl to our beds about 8 o'clock."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-21,25,50,N/A,21. We were better this morning but not equal to much walking. We rambled to a pretty stream and there sat watching a caterpillar. When it had been cut in two the fore-part set to work to devour the other hal£ In the afternoon we had a two hours' walk in the pine woods. They are sublime.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-22,25,50,N/A,"22. This morning we set out to find the Gabelbach. It rained a little, but still our walk was very pleasant. From the Gabelbach we went on to Kickelhahn, where Goethe's queer little wooden house stands. We wrote our names near one of the windows. The view ofhills from this point is very grand. We did exploits on our way home, not knowing the road, and were amused to find ourselves at last at the spot from which we had begun our uphill walk to the Gabelbach. In the evening we turned out again and walked to Elgersberg."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-23,25,50,N/A,23 Saturday. We went to Elgersberg and continued along the Chaussee till we came to Stutzerbach where we took a guide to Gabelbach. He took us up the hills through glorious pine and beech woods.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-24,25,50,N/A,"24 Sunday. We walked from Ilmenau to Arnstadt - a 4 hours' journey. The road is very fine and varied. Dined at the Goldene Henne, and had a boar's head splendidly decorated with green branches, a lemon in its mouth and a cross formed of carrot on its brow. We got the coupe of the Post Wagen and travelled comfortably to Neu Dietendorf, where we waited half an hour, for the train to Weimar. We reached home about half past 6 and enjoyed taking coffee snugly in our own lodgings once more. I read the Kestner letters at Ilmenau."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-25,25,50,N/A,"25. The morning looked so lovely that we were tempted to walk to Bercka, but it became very windy before we had been out long. The little valley looked more lovely than ever. We had a smart shower on setting out home, but were compensated by the sight of a lovely rainbow, which sprang from the very ground. It continued fine after this and we had a delicious evening walk."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-26,25,50,N/A,"26. In the afternoon we called at Herr Scholl's, had some pleasant chat with him and his wife, and then walked in the Park, Scholl accompanying us."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-27,25,50,N/A,"27. Mr Williams, an agreeable, unaffected young man, took coffee with us. In the evening we set out to go to Belvedere, but turned off into the open fields and found out a new walk. The sky was grand."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-28,25,50,N/A,"28 Thursday. The morning was too beautiful to be spent in doors, so we set out on the same walk that we had yesterday, and got atlastto Belvedere, where we went to look at the landscapes in the glass globes."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-29,25,50,N/A,29. In the afternoon the Princess Wittgenstein called and chatted pleasantly. G. then went to Mr. Wilson's to meet Eckermann.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-09-30,25,50,N/A,30. G. dined at the Marquis de Ferriere's.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-10-01,26,51,N/A,Oct. 1. In the morning I partly condensed Liszt's article on Meyerbeer for the Vivian paper. In the evening walked and read aloud the Wahlverwandtschaften.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-10-02,26,51,N/A,"2. Finished Liszt's article. In the evening we went to the theatre and saw ""Die Journalisten"". Genast, an actor of Goethe 's time, was admirably humourous in
the character of an obese wine-merchant. The face and tone with which he said ""Es ist hiibsch heute, Lotte "" is something to be remembered."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-10-03,26,51,N/A,"3 Tuesday. Mr. Marshall called and immediately after came the Marquis de Ferriere. We had an hour's agreeable talk about Byron etc. etc. and when the marquis left we had a little walk with Mr. Marshall. He spoke of Strauss with great admiration - thought the man excellent as well as the writer. At 1/2 past 6 we went to hear Tannhauser. The overture and the first and second acts thrilled me, but the third I felt rather wearisome. The tragedy in this act is very fine, but either I was too much fatigued to relish the music, or it is intrinsically monotonous and spun out beyond any but German patience."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-10-04,26,51,N/A,"4 Wednesday. Translated in the morning and wrote to Mr. Chapman. In the afternoon walked to Belvedere with Mr. Marshall, met Mr Wilson on our return and took tea with him. He told us that one day when he had been walking with Carlyle who as usual had his dog with them, they were about to get into an omnibus and Carlyle drew out a horribly noisy whistle with which he summoned his dog. ""Don't make that noise, man!"" said the conductor of the
omnibus; and Carlyle was at once silent, feeling himself rebuked."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-10-05,26,51,N/A,5. Thursday. G. dined at the Marquis de Ferriere's and I read Rameau's Neffe.

In the evening we went to hear ""Der Markt von Richmond"", an opera of Flotow's, a mere ragout ofborrowed scraps."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-10-08,26,51,N/A,"8 Sunday. Mr. Marshall called in the morning and walked with us. We called on Eckermann, who is interesting to look at though shattered in mind and body."

Diary 1954-1861,1854-10-11,26,51,N/A,11 Wednesday. I was ill this morning and staid in doors all day. G. went to call on the Princess and had some interesting conversation with her about Madame d' Agout and Liszt. A painful letter from London caused us both a bad night.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-10-12,27,52,N/A,"12. I was still not well enough to go out. The Marquis de Ferriere called in the afternoon, and afterwards Mr. Marshall. It rained heavily the whole day."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-10-13,27,52,N/A,13 Friday. Better. G. wrote letters to Carlyle and Helps explaining his position. The rain continued all day.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-10-14,27,52,N/A,"14. A fine morning once more. I walked out with G. Began to read Egmont after dinner, then ""The Hoggarty Diamond"". Walking in the afternoon we met Schöll and he turned back with us. I received a letter from sister-with melancholy news about her boy Robert- and a letter from Mr. Chapman. G. dined with the
Marquis de Ferriére."

Diary 1954-1861,1854-10-16,27,52,N/A,"16 Monday. A dismal, rainy day. The Michaelmas fair, which is going on, causes an incessant buzz of voices under our windows, not soothing to the nerves. I wrote to Mr. Bray. In the afternoon Mr. Marshall sat with us for an hour or two. The rest of the time was filled up with the ""Hoggarty Diamond""."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-10-17,27-28,52-53,N/A,"17 Tuesday. The weather has cleared up and we have had a pleasant walk once more. We have been to the Bibliothek again, that I might see the busts etc. on the upper floor. The bust of Gluck by Houdon gave me new pleasure. I never saw more reality and animation even in a portrait. The bust of Lessing too impresses one as a probable likeness. It is full of bright good sense. But one gets sceptical about all busts and portraits on comparing the cast of Schiller 's skull with the head given to his bust. When the eyebrows of the bust and that of the skull are placed on a level, the departure of the artist from the true proportions is so gross that one sees it can have arisen from no mere incorrectness of perception , but only from a false principle. The same disgust at the incompetence or
untruthfulness of artists is produced by the discrepant portraits and busts of Goethe; but there is one likeness ofhim that is really startling and thrilling from the idea it gives one of perfect resemblance. It is painted on a cup and is a tiny miniature, but the execution is so perfect that on applying a magnifying glass every minute stroke has as natural an appearance as the texture of a flower
or the parts of an insect under the microscope. In a sort of cupboard with glass doors are preserved the coat in which Gustavus Adolphus was shot , Luther's gown, Goethe's court coat, and his Schlafrock, etc. There are endless trifles preserved in the various rooms-toys that pleased Carl Friedrich, the last Duke - a nodding and winking figure etc. The only portraits that had any interest for me in the smaller rooms are those of the Grand Duchess Amalia and the Jagermann, Carl August's mistress. In the large Saal of the Library there is a portrait of Kant which one likes to look at in the faint hope that it may resemble him a little, but the grand objects of interest are the bust of Gluck , the portrait of Goethe on the cup, and the relics of Gustavus Adolphus, Luther and Goethe.
The bust of Goethe taken when he was in Italy by Trippel is strikingly beautiful, but it is evidently so idealized on the Apollo type and so degraded by the front fuyant which the artist has chosen to give it that one has little satisfaction in looking at it. - In the afternoon finished the Hoggarty Diamond. Mr. Marshall came to sit with us and then we went to the Theatre to see ""Der verwunschene Prinz"", a farce founded on Shakspeare's Christopher Sly. Hettstedt, the Christopher Sly of the piece acted with great entrain and humour. This was followed by a vaudeville adapted from the French, ""Gu ten Morgen, Herr Fischer"", in which Franke acted the part of Doctor Hippe admirably."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-10-18,28,53,N/A,"18 Wednesday. Mr. Marshall brought us the Life of Sheridan and sat chatting with us and then walked out. A sombre autumn afternoon. In the evening we went to see Der Freischiitz which I had never seen before, though familiar with the music. The childish  construction of the drama made still more apparent by the rude bug-a-boo style in which it was put on the stage. The absence of recitative- the descent from Weber's rich melody to ordinary speaking intolerable. And set in Germany- this land of music- they even play Don Juan without recitative!"
Diary 1954-1861,1854-10-20,28,53,N/A,"20 Friday. G. got some interesting particulars from Frau Riemer about Goethe - especially about his attachment to Minna Herzlieb, which threw light on the sad experience he declares himself to have deposited ""as in a burial um"" in the Wahlverwandtschaften. I read Egmont in the evening. Curiously enough after we had been making up our minds in the morning thatthe Schölls had some reason for being cold to us, there came an invitation from them to tea at 8 o'clock. Before we went came a letter of noble sympathy from Carlyle. Our evening was very pleasantly passed at the Schölls'. Mr. Marshall and the Sauppes
there."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-10-21,28,53,N/A,21 Saturday. A letter from Helps the first thing this morning. In the afternoon we walked with the Schölls and Sauppe. In the morning we had had a glorious walk to Belvedere and in the grounds there. Egmont in the evening. Moore's Life of Sheridan.

Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-04,33,58,N/A,"4 Saturday. After Breakfast went out in search of lodgings, and at length fixed on 62, Dorotheen Strasse, at 28 thalers per month. Dined at the Hotel de l'Europe and at 6 o'clock came to our lodgings and unpacked."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-05,33,58,N/A,Sunday 5. A bright morning. We walked out and met Varnhagen in the Linden. Dined at the Hôtel de l'Europe. In the evening G. went to Fräulein Solmar's. Berlin is very much what I expected. The people look very smart and brisk after the Weimarians.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-07,33,58,N/A,Tuesday 7. Varnhagen called and invited us to take tea with him on Thursday. A fine looking courtly old man. He told us ofhis disappointment in Carlyle when after years of correspondence they at last met in the body. Carlyle was full of anathemas against the Frau von Stein. Read Vehse's Weimar in the evening.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-08,33,58,N/A,Wednesday 8. Began translating Spinoza's Ethics. Wrote to Mrs. Robert Noel to thank her for trying to get me an introduction to Humboldt. Read Wilhelm Meister aloud in the evening.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-09,33,58,N/A,"Thursday. 9. Read Rosenkranz on the Faust Sage. Translated Spinoza. Dessoir came and staid more than an hour. Then we walked out and looked at the engravings in the Linden. At so' clock went to Varnhagen's and found a very pleasant little party: Fraulein Solmar, Frau Nimsch, Doctor Ring, Dr. Vehse, Grafin von Kalkreit, and Director Wilhelm Schadow, author of""Der moderne Vasari"". We talked of Goethe; Varnhagen brought out autographs and portraits and read us an epigram ofhis own on the want ofliberality which Goethe's family shew about opening his house to the public. He showed us a portrait of Kleist who shot himselfin company with Frau Vogel near an inn on the way to Potsdam. There was no love affair between them: they were both thoroughly unhappy, he poor and hopeless for the future, and she suffering from an incurable disease. In the evening they both wrote on a single sheet of paper letters to their friends communicating their intention. (This sheet Varnhagen possesses.) Early in the morning they rose, took a cup of coffee, went to the brink of a piece of water in the neighbourhood of the inn and there shot themselves. We came away at 8. Fraulein Assing, Varnhagen's niece, lent me a volume of Heine's poems. I read aloud ""Donna Clara'' and then Wilhelm Meister till 10."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-10,33-34,58-59,N/A,"10 Friday. We walked through the Museum this morning and were struck with the beauty of the interior and the excellent arrangement of the works of art. Not many very valuable pictures, but still an interesting collection. Titian's daughter, Correggio's ""Schweisstuch"" and some portraits of Titian's school particularly impressed me. We came home and wrote a little. The day then became very unpleasant with snow and sleet. We battled our way to the Hotel de
l'Europe for dinner and enjoyed the thought of getting back into our warm rooms with the ""feste Vorschlag"" not to turn out again. I read Wilhelm Meister aloud, and then G. read part of the Merchant of Venice."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-11,34,59,N/A,"11 Saturday. I read Heine's poems; wrote a few recollections of Weimar and translated Genealogical Tables of the Goethe family. Then we went to call on Fraulein von Solmar, who was exceedingly agreeable, and invited me to visit her when I pleased of an evening. Walked to the Wilhelmsplatz and Leipziger Platz, for the first time. In the evening went to see ""Nathan der Weise"". The Theatre very elegant and comfortable. Doring as Nathan excellent. The Patriarch immensely comic- ""Es thut nichts, der Jude wird verbrannt"", the essence of
the dogmatic spirit. Both thrilled by the grandeur of the sentiments. I felt that it was a noble inspiration which dictated such writing. The scenery was excellent, particularly a street inJ erusalem and the garden in the last scene. The sky was grand on our way to the theatre - the stars bright on a sable field. I began Lessing's Laocoon in bed."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-12,34,59,N/A,"12 Sunday. Wrote to Mr. Bray. Walked till dinner. Went to Kroll's-a wonderful kind of Casino, where there are concerts, theatricals, balls, and dinners. Read Wilhelm Meister and G's MS."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-13,34,59,N/A,"13 Monday. Letter from Mr. Noel enclosing a letter for Humboldt. Read
Laocoon. Translated Spinoza. Du Bois-Reymond called just as we came in from Dinner. He spoke very decidedly of the German civilization as inferior to the English. A handsome, young looking man. He spoke English very well, and accounted for it by telling us that he had an English wife. In the evening came Gruppe-a cordial, lively man. He gave us an interesting account ofhis work on the Cosmic systems of the Greeks."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-[14],34,59,N/A,"Tuesday. We took tea atFraulein von Solmar's. General Pfuhl, Varnhagen and his niece (Fräulein von Assing), Baron Sternberg, Drs. Crepet, and Vehse. In the morning Dessoir came, and after dinner Johannes von Muller called."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-15,34,59,N/A,"Wednesday. 15. G. called on Fanny Lewald. In the evening we went to
Spargnapini's, and had some chocolate and read the papers. G. finished reading allowed [sic] the Merchant of Venice, and I the first vol. of Wilhelm Meister."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-16,34,59,N/A,Thursday 16. Fanny Lewald called. Letter from Herbert Spencer.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-17,34,59,N/A,Friday 17. We strolled into the Museum and looked at the Flemish pictures. The beauty of detail and the marvellous painting of still life in some of the pictures which belong to a low development of art is very remarkable. Here is the original of Vandyke's famous portrait of Charles the 1st's children.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-[18],34,59,N/A,Saturday. Ill all day and unable to go out. G. finished Romeo and Juliet.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-19,34-35,59-60,N/A,"Sunday 19. Finished Lessing's Laocoon -the most un-German of all German books that I have ever read. The style is strong clear and lively, the thoughts acute and pregnant. It is well adapted to rouse an interest both in the classics and in the study of art. After working as usual, we walked in the Thier-garten and saw many new spots. In the evening we went to Fraulein von Solmar's."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-21,35,60,N/A,"Tuesday 21. Wrote to Herbert Spencer.L etters from Coventry. In the evening went to Gruppe's. Amusing simplicity with which he played the schoolboy's trick with the three lumps of sugar under three hats. He drew some Jews' faces with a pen admirably. We attempted ""Brag"" or ""Pochen"", bu t Gruppe presently
became alarmed at G's play and said ""Das wtirde an zwölf groschen reichen!"" Then G. diverted them with tricks and so concluded the evening rather brilliantly."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-[22],35,60,N/A,"Wednesday. Wrote letters to Coventry and to my brother. In the evening went to the theatre to see Emilia Galotti. The acting bad with the exception of Dessoir's (Masinelli). The play seems to me a wretched mistake of Lessing's. The Roman myth ofVirginius is grand, but the situation transported to modern times and divested ofits political bearing is simply shocking. Read Nathan on
coming home."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-[23],35,60,N/A,"Thursday 24 [23]. Began ""Briefe über Spinoza"". Walked a couple ofhours in the Thiergarten. The snow beautiful on the trees for the first time. Translated andwrote Recollections till dinner. In the evening Rauch, the sculptor came - the finest old man I ever saw and the most charming. His head is noble, his features harmonious and his expression extremely winning. He told us many interesting things about Goethe whom he knew well, and thoroughly agreed with G's quotation from Jung Stilling. Rauch is tall and finely formed; his beautiful head is surmounted with silky, wavy white hair, and when he is standing he is really grand. It was a sort of cordial to look at him, his face was so
beaming."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-[24],35,60,N/A,"Friday 25 [24]. Went to Mlle. Solmar's in the evening to meet a cousin of Frau von Goethe's, who however was not there. Varnhagen, as usual very agreeable and Dr. Vehse very noisy. In the morning a letter from Mr.Noel introducing Dr. Fischer."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-[25],35-36,60-61,N/A,"Saturday. The weather continues disagreeable and the streets dirty. Read Jacobi's Briefe tiber Spinoza. Wrote to Dr. Fischer. Translated Spinoza, on final causes. Walked out to the Neue Museum, but found we were too late, so came back and lounged in a bookshop. Home for half an hour and read Na than der
Weise. ""Wandlungen"" at Dinner. Wilhelm Meister aloud. About 1/2 past 6 the Gruppes came, sat with us some time and asked us to go to see them on Tuesday and meet Waagen. G. read Julius Cesar aloud, as far as Cæsar's appearance in the senate house. Very much struck with the masculine style of this play and its
vigorous moderation compared with Romeo and Juliet."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-[26],36,61,N/A,"Sunday. After working, we walked till dinner time in the Thiergarten. I read
aloud Wilhelm Meister and then G. finished Julius Cæsar. At 9 o'clock we turned out to Spargnapini's, to have chocolate and see the papers. Gruppe sent to invite us for to-morrow instead ofTuesday."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-[27],36,61,N/A,"Monday. Waited at home for Dr. Fischer who didn't come. Then walked in the Thiergarten half an hour alone. In the evening went to Gruppe's. Dr. Waagen, his wife and daughters were there. He is an intelligent, lively man. His wife serious looking because of bad teeth. Amusing judgment passed on Goethethat he was ""Kein dummer mann!"" Capital story of a lady who went to see him as an intellectual adorer, and began to spout to him, as his masterpiece, ""Festgemauert in der Erden"" etc."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-[28],36,61,N/A,"Tuesday. Wrote to Chrissey. A clear, lovely morning."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-[29],36,61,N/A,Wednesday. Finished Minna von Barnhelm. Finished Wilhelm Meister. G. began Antony and Cleopatra. Snowy and wet. Magnus the chemist called.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-11-[30],36,61,N/A,Thursday. Finished Recollections of Weimar. Began the Italiiinische Reise.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-[12]-[01],36,61,N/A,"Friday. Not well in the morning. Finished Fanny Lewald's Wandlungen. In the evening went to the theatre to see ""Die Königin von Navarre"", a translation of a French piece. Poor and badly acted."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-[12]-[02],36,61,N/A,"Saturday. Bad headache. In the evening to the Theatre to see Othello. Dessoir as Othello, Doring as Iago, Frau Hoppe as Desdemona."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-[12]-[03],36,61,N/A,Sunday. Shocking weather still. Walked in the Thiergarten. Dispute with our landlord. Looked at Scherr's Deutsche Cultur und Sitte. In the evening read Italiänische Reise-residencine Venice. G. read Antony and Cleopatra.

principally with Pro£ Stahr, about German style, Lessing, Spinoza, History of Jesus etc."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-12-[05],36-37,61-62,N/A,"Tuesday. G's head bad. So we went to Magnus's, saw his portraits and had an
agreeable chat with him. A man whose ideas are bornées, but acute,
straight forward and amiable. Portraits of Thorwaldsen, Mendelssohn and Sontag. As we were returning home, Dessoir called out ""Bonjour"" behind us and came in with us. Discussed his Othello. He said he found himself inevitably led into sing-song declamation by Schiller, but with Shakspear it was impossible to be declamatory. ""'shakspear,' he said, 'ist mein Gott- ich babe keinen anderen Gott.' "" Magnus, the other day, told us a rich story about Carlyle. At a dinner party given by Magnus in honour of Carlyle, Wiese and Cornelius were deploring Goethe's want of evangelical sentiment. Carlyle was
visibly uneasy, fumbling with his dinner napkin. At last, he broke out thus:
""Meine Herren, kennen Sie die Anekdote von dem Manne, der die Sonne lasterte weil sie ihn seine Cigarre nicht anstecken liess?"" In the evening we read the Italianische Reise- the residence in Rome. A beautiful description of Rome and the Coliseum by moonlight- a fire made in the Coliseum sending its smoke, silvered by the moonlight, through the arches of the mighty walls. Amusing story of his landlady's cat worshipping Jupiter by licking his beard- a miracle in her esteem, explained by Goethe as a discovery the cat had made of
the oil lodging in the undulations of the beard."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-12-06,37,62,N/A,"Wednesday 6. G's head not well, so at 1 o'clock we set off to the Thiergarten, and explored a part we had not seen before. Talked about the factitious admiration of the Old English dramatists got up by Charles Lamb's selections - Schlegela nd his criticisms etc. Walkedb ack only just in time to dine at the British Hotel. The dinner splendid, but too dear for our pocket- 20 groschen each. Read Italiänische Reise - Residence in Naples. Pretty passage about a star seen through a chink in the ceiling as he lay in bed. G. read Henry IV, and about ¼ past the Gruppes came. They staid chatting till after 10."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-12-[07],37,62,N/A,"Thursday. I have begun Scherr's Geschichte Deutschen Cultur und Sitte. Worked at Spinoza. Walked in the Thier garten. Dined at Pietsch's, and then went into Kranzler's where G. was to wait for Magnus the Chemist, who had promised to take him to the Sitz of the Akademie. However he soon came back to me, having wisely given up the Sitz in favour of a party at Prof. Olfers', where he was to go with Magnus the painter. I read the Italianische Reise till it was time for him to dress. It is remarkable that when Goethe gets to Sicily, he is for the first time in Italy enthusiastic in his descriptions of natural beauty. G. went at 8 and I spent the evening alone for the first time since we have been at Berlin. I read G's Farce- Robson's adventure with a Russian Princess. Letter from Mr. Chapman - a chef d' ceuvre ofbad taste."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-12-[08],37-38,62-63,N/A,"Thursday [Friday]. Read Scherr-worked at Spinoza-walked in the
Thiergarten. A lovely morning. We talked of Keely and Macready. Came home and wrote a little, then went to dine at the Hotel de l'Europe. I took Iphigenia to read. Italianische Reise until Dessoir came. He read us the opening of Richard the 3rd and the scene with Lady Anne. Then Shylock, which G. afterwards read. Dessoir told us an amusing story out of his early experiences among strolling actors, and imitated admirably Aldridge's mode of advancing to kill Duncan - like a wild Indian lurking for a not much wilder beast. Finished 1st act of Iphigenia."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-12-[09],38,63,N/A,Saturday. Miserably wet day. Read Scherr- Mythology of the Germans. Worked at Spinoza. Wrote to Mr. Chapman. Read Italianische Reise aloud. G. read Henry IV.

Diary 1954-1861,1854-12-[12],38,63,N/A,"Tuesday. Scherr. Spinoza. Dessoir walked with us in the Thiergarten and told us an amusing story about his early days. When he was a youth of sixteen or seventeen acting at Spandau, he walked to Berlin (about 9 miles) and back in the evening accompanied by a watchmaker named Naundorf, an enthusiast for the theatre. On their way Dessoir declaimed at the top ofhis voice and was encouraged by the applause ofhis companion to more and more exertion of lungs and limbs, so that people stared at them and followed them as if they thought them two madmen. This watchmaker was Louis XVII! Dined at the Hotel de !'Europe and read Iphigenia. Looked into the Xenien and amused ourselves with their pointlessness. Read Hermann and Dorothea - 4 first books. G. read 2nd Part ofHenry IV."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-12-[13],38,63,N/A,"Wednesday. Scherr. Head not clear, so I did not get through much of Spinoza this morning. Dined by Dessoir's invitation at Diets's, to meet Hofrath Forster and Professor Roetscher. The former served in the Prussian army at Waterloo - Theodor Korner died in his arms."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-12-[14],38,63,N/A,Thursday. Bad headache. A regularly wet morning. Read the Athenæum and Leader and finished Iphigenia. In the evening finished Hermann and Dorothea. Read Henry IV 2nd part. Still headachy.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-12-[15],38,63,N/A,"Friday. Wretched weather- impossible to walk out. Read Scherr. Worked at
Spinoza. Read G's MS. - Weimar period. Went to the Opera for the first time to hear ""Die Stumme von Portici"". Very well put on the stage, and the orchestra good, but the singing bad. Formes, the tenor, is a stumpy man with neither voice, execution, nor dramatic talent. His wife acted Fenella prettily. We left at the end of the third act, and enjoyed walking about in the fresh air. When we came in, G. finished Henry IV 2nd part. A letter from Mrs. Noel telling me that her husband is called to join his militia regiment."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-12-16,38,63,N/A,Saturday. 16. Scherr. Spinoza. At 12 I went to take a warm bath. Then wrote to Mrs. Noel and we walked till dinner. At the Hotel de !'Europe. Began Tasso aloud. G. read two acts of As you like it.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-12-[17],39,64,N/A,"Sunday. Scherr. Worked well at Spinoza. From 1 to 2 we walked in the
Thiergarten and enjoyed greatly the clear air and sunshine, which has been so long wanting. Came home and worked an hour longer- then went to dine at the Hôtel de l'Europe. On our way home Dessoir overtook us and came with us. He staid till 8 o'clock talking chiefly of Hamlet and discussing the question of madness or affectation of madness. Read Scherr."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-12-18,39,64,N/A,"Monday. 18. Read Scherr. Finished revising Part I of Spinoza's Ethics. Walked till dinner. Read a little of Tasso and then we went to Prof. Gruppe's and spent a pleasant evening with him, his wife and her naïve sister. G. acted a little of Shylock for them. I was amused to see that the young women's feeling towards the Jews was not much above that of Graciano and co. Frau Gruppe when running through the wonderful speech ""Hath not a Jew eyes"" etc turned round to us and said ""They don't feel- they don't care how they are used"". Gruppe read us a translation of one of the Homeric Hymns-Aphrodite-which is really beautiful. It is a sort of Gegenstück to ""Der Gott und die Bayadere"". He has struck out 150 lines which he believes to be interpolated and the connection of the poem appears perfect. Gruppe's theory of the numerous interpolations found in ancient authors is, that booksellers or rather publishers foisted them in order to recommend their new editions as possessing something new."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-12-[19],39,64,N/A,Tuesday. Scherr. Began Part II of Ethics. Walked into the town and in the Thiergarten. Came in and wrote. In the evening we expected Magnus but he didn't come. I began to read aloud the Wanderjahre. G. read 'As you like it'. Tasso.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-12-[20],39,64,N/A,Wednesday. Scherr. Spinoza. Tasso to dinner. Began Heine's Geständnisse and immensely amused with his wit. Went to Frau Solmar's and had a very pleasant evening.
Diary 1954-1861,1854-12-[21],39-40,64-65,N/A,"Thursday. Scherr- much interested in his sketch of German poetry in the
Middle Ages. Copied the appendix to 1st book of Ethics. We walked out
determined to explore the town a little and went along the Friedrichstrasse to the Oranien thor, a ridiculously ugly structure. Passing through this gate we pursued a road which brought us within sight of a high bronze column surmounted by a column. We thought this worth going to and found that it is dedicated to those who fell for ""Gott, König und Vaterland"" in 1848 and 1849. It is really a splendid monument. There is a sort of court round it on the walls of which polished granite tablets contain in golden letters the names of the
""martyrs"" to whom the column is dedicated. The King of Prussia's unpleasant face stands in medallion over the inscription in front of the column - speaking very ill for the God with whom he makes common cause. If this fine monument had been dedicated to some real heroism how it would have thrilled us! Finished
Tasso. After coffee, finished aloud Heine's Geständnisse. The wit
burns low after the first 50 pages and the want of principle and purpose make it wearisome. G. finished ""As you like it"". He then went to Pro£ Olfers', and I wrote at Spinoza."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-12-[22],40,65,N/A,"Friday. Scherr, Spinoza, walk in the rain. Began Lessing's Hamburgische Briefe at dinner. Read aloud Heine's ""Götter im Exil"" and some ofhis poems. G read Lear. Copied out some translation for G."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-12-23,40,65,N/A,"Sat. 23. Scherr. Spinoza. A lovely day once again. We had a delightful walk in the Thiergarten. An uncomfortable letter came for G. from London. G. went with Dessoir to call on Roetscher so I came home alone and turned over the Dichtung und Wahrheit. When G. came in again read Wanderjahre á mourir
d'ennui."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-12-[24],40,65,N/A,"Sunday. Read Scherr- Scholasticism, Universities and Roman law. Worked at Spinoza. Walked to the Neue Museum, but failed to get in. Came home and copied Goethe's Discourse on Shakspeare. Read, at dinner, his wonderful observations on Spinoza. Particularly struck with the beautiful modesty of the passage in which he says he cannot presume to say that he thoroughly understands Spinoza. After Coffee read aloud G's M.S. of the Leipsic and beginning of the Strasburg Period. G. finished Lear- sublimely powerful!"
Diary 1954-1861,1854-12-[25],40,65,N/A,"Monday. Christmas day. Miserably wet. Read Scherr- Birth of the modern
drama in the Mysteries. Made little way in Spinoza from inclination to
headache. Wrote to Mr. Bray. Read Wanderjahre. Taming of the Shrew."

Diary 1954-1861,1854-12-[28],40,65,N/A,"Thursday. Translated passages from the Kestner letters. It was a lovely morning and we enjoyed walking 2 hours, first in the Thiergarten and afterwards in the town. As we were coming in we met Stahr and Fanny Lewald who had been calling on us and we agreed to go to see them tomorrow evening. Read at dinner Goethe's account ofhis relations with Herder at Strasburg in Dichtung und Wahrheit. Continued aloud Heine's Salon. G. read Knight's Studies of Shakspeare. Twaddling in the extreme."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-12-29,41,66,N/A,"Friday 29. A fine frosty morning. Wrote to Mr. Noel and to my Sister. Worked a little at Spinoza but not well enough to do much. Read a little of Scherr. Read aloud Heine's Salon. Then we went to Prof. Stahr's and spent the evening there. A remarkable miniature of Schiller of which there is no engraving. We talked of the Wahlverwandschaften, amongst other things. Stahr finding fault with the
denouement which I defended. (Concession or license)"
Diary 1954-1861,1854-12-[30],41,66,N/A,"Saturday. Rainy again. After breakfast we went to the Bank and then on to
Rauch's Atelier, where we found the beautiful old man superintending the
modelling of a statue of Moses praying with Aaron and Hur holding up his arms. This was the first visit I ever paid to a sculptor's atelier. It was very interesting to me to see the small clay model done by Rauch himself- the wonderful expression thrown into the bit of clay forming the face of Moses. We also saw his model for a statue of Kant. Rauch himself saw Kant in 1789. When we went into the other rooms on the opposite side of the court we were joined by M. Crepet the goodlooking Frenchman who is writing a book about Prussia. Some workmen were finishing in marble the figure of the King of Hanover, to be placed on a sarcophagus. There was a Danaïd in marble- not striking. A monument of the Queen Luise in another room was all that had any interest for us. We paddled home through the rain and were in again at 1 o'clock. Rauch is 75 or 77. A curious black silhouette ofKant interested me extremely. -G's head bad in the evening so that we had little reading."
Diary 1954-1861,1854-12-31,41,66,N/A,"Sunday. Dec. 31. Translated passages from Kestner's letters. Began Stahr's
Torso. Read, after coffee, G's MS. Then we went to Fraulein Solmar's- not at home. Came back and G read Coriolanus. I read some of Stahr to him, but we found it too long-winded a style for reading aloud."
Diary 1954-1861,1855-01-01,41,66,N/A,Monday 1 [January 1855 ]. Read Stahr. Worked at Spinoza. Read Heine in the evening-on German Philosophy. G. read Coriolanus.
Diary 1954-1861,1855-01-02,41,66,N/A,"Tuesday 2. Stahr. Spinoza and bit of Kestner letters. Warm bath, walk and
dinner, with Athen~um. In the evening read a bit of Heine and then went to the Opera to hear Johanna Wagner in Gluck's Orpheus and Eurydice. Delighted with the music and with her singing and acting, but irritated by the stupid ballet-girl groups in Elysium and in the last scene before the temple of Love. The Greek shades in the back ground in Elysium looked like butchers in women's chemises. Tuczek, who was Amor, and sang very well, had a headdress which made her look like a shop-girl, and the Eurydice who sang disagreeably was such a scarecrow that she made the long act between her and Orpheus almost ludicrous. We talked about symbolism-how far it prevailed among the Greeks. I got a dreadful headache from the bad air and rushed to bed when we reached home."
Diary 1954-1861,1855-01-03,41-42,66-67,N/A,"Wednesday 3. My head was better so that I was able to work well at Spinoza all morning. Then we walked out and turned into the Museum to glance at the pictures -Titian's daughter, Correggio's Semele, and a charming ""Weibliche Figur"" in a brown mantle. Read Heine in the evening and felt my headache returning. G. finished Coriolanus. Went to bed with a bad headache."
Diary 1954-1861,1855-01-04,42,67,N/A,"Thursday 4. Head still bad-unable to work. Took a bath and walked a little till dinner. Read Heine. Walked in the avenue leading to Kroll's, which looked pretty, lighted with gas. G. then went to Prof. Olfers'. I went to bed early, not being well yet."
Diary 1954-1861,1855-01-05,42,67,N/A,"Friday 5. Better. Read a little of Stahr and worked a little at Spinoza. At
12 Gruppe surprized us and staid chatting nearly an hour. Thinks Shakspear more extensively sold in Germany than any other works except the Bible and Schiller! Read Hamburgische Briefe at dinner. G. went to Dessoir's and at 6 o'clock returned with Dessoir, who read some of Hamlet to us and staid talking till 8. Then we went to Fraulein Solmar's. Glad to see the old General Pfuhl once again. G. read Shylock, but seemed to be very imperfectly understood."
Diary 1954-1861,1855-01-[06],42,67,N/A,"Saturday. Dr. Fischer called and brought me Kugler's History of Painting with a pamphlet by himself. Then Magnus came and chatted for an hour or so. I finished Heine's Salon. G read some of Twelfth Night, but his head got bad and he was obliged to leave off."
Diary 1954-1861,1855-01-[07],42,67,N/A,"Sunday. Not well this morning and made little way in my work. We had a long walk in the Thiergarten. G was to have gone to Graf York's in the evening, but felt poorly, so he staid at home. Read Goethe's Maxims in the Wanderjahre. Then we compared several scenes of Hamlet in Schlegel's translation with the original. It is generally very close and often admirably well done but Shakspear's strong concrete language is almost always weakened. For example, ""Though this hand were thicker than itself in brother's blood"" is rendered ""auch um und um in Bruder's Blut getauct"". The prose speeches of Hamlet lose all their felicity in the translation."
Diary 1954-1861,1855-01-[08],42,67,N/A,"Monday. Stahr on the Eginetan sculptures. Spinoza. Walked in the
Thiergarten. Came back and wrote a little before going to dinner. Read Dr.
Fischer's pamphlet. Read Wanderjahre- Die Neue Melusine. Stahr."
Diary 1954-1861,1855-01-[09],42,67,N/A,"Tuesday. Not well. We walked outtill nearly 1. Then G. dictated article on Mrs

Diary 1954-1861,1855-01-[17],43,68,N/A,"Wednesday. Stahr. Little done at Spinoza, as I was not well and went to have a bath. We walked in the Thiergarten and being too late for our usual dining place went into a new one in the Charlotten Strasse. Finished the poetry of the West-Östliche Divan.

before dinner, but suffered terribly from the cold. Read the wondrously
beautiful ""Römische Elegien"" again and some of the Venetian Epigrams. G. began ""Winter's Tale"". Wrote to his dictation an article on Gluck and Johanna Wagner. Received a letter from Mr. Chapman requesting me to prepare an article on Vehse's Court of Austria for the next No. of the Westminster."
Diary 1954-1861,1855-01-21,43-44,68-69,N/A,"Sunday 21. The snow has fallen at last and it is a little milder. Wrote to Mr.
Chapman agreeing to write the article on Vehse and to my sister proposing to send her £10 this year for Emily's school bill. This evening we went to Mlle. Solmar's. A Frenchman there amused us by saying that he found in Meyerbeer's Huguenots the whole spirit of the epoch of Charles IX. ""Lisez les Chroniques"" - de Froissart, suggested Mlle. Solmar- ""Oui quelque chose comme ça, ou bien les Chroniques de Bran tome ou de Merimée, et vous trouverez que Meyerbeer a parfaitement exprimé tout cela-du moins c' est ce [que] je trouve moi."" I said: ""Mais, peutetre Monsieur, c'est votre genie a vous qui a fait entrer les idees clans la musique."" He answered with complacent deprecation. G. looked
immovably serious; but was inwardly tickled by the audacity of my compliment and the evident acceptance of it."
Diary 1954-1861,1855-01-[22],44,69,N/A,"Monday. Read Stahr. Called on Miss Assing to try and borrow Vehse's book
from Varnhagen. He does not possess it, so G. called on Vehse and asked him to lend it me; he was very much pleased to do so. In the evening read G's MS., finished the Venetian epigrams, read the ""Zueignung"" to the ""Gedichte"" and several of the Ballads. G. read Winter's Tale."

He came to us at sand chatted until 6. Then we went to hear the reading of Gruppe's Ferdusi. But the reading was bad and the room insufferably hot. So we came away and read Shakspeare at home.

went to see the ""Fechter von Ravenna"". The Fechter is Thumelieus the Son of Arminius. Thusnelda his mother, discovers her son in this position and to save him from the dishonour of appearing as a gladiator, she kills him. Dessoir as Caligula was very good. Madame Crelinger, as Thusnelda, made the wearisome part doubly wearisome by her want of feeling. She is nearly sixty. Her voice is
still fine and her declamation often good. Dr. Fischer called this morning."

One room is devoted to the sculptures of the Parthenon and the Eginetan Sculptures which are admirably arranged. We saw some fine sketches by Kaulbach of the ""Sage"" History, Architecture etc."
Diary 1954-1861,1855-02-06,45,70,N/A,"6. Tuesday. I took cold at the Museum yesterday and began this morning to feel very uncomfortable from it. Wrote from Vehse. Went out in the evening first to Stahr's, who was gone to be married at last to Fanny Lewald after 9 years of waiting, then to Gruppe's who also was not at home and finally to Fraulein Solmar's.

Diary 1954-1861,1855-02-25,46,71,N/A,"Sunday. 25. Since I last wrote in my Journal, I have been working well at my article on Vehse and have finished two thirds ofit, we have spent an evening with the Stahrs and had visits from the Gruppes and Magnus. The weather is at length milder, and thick as the snow was it has almost disappeared in two days thaw- that is to say as white snow, for a great deal still remains as mud in the streets. I have been very poorly several days this week but have nevertheless managed to work. We have read Macaulay every evening, but no Shakspear. This evening I have been reading aloud G's M.S. ofhis last Book so far as he has done it."
Diary 1954-1861,1855-03-05,46,71,N/A,"Monday March 5. A great part of this week has been lost from terrible headache which came on on Tuesday and lasted till Saturday. On Thursday we went to Dr. Parthey's, formerly Nicolai's to see some illustrations of Shakspear by Kaulbach. We saw the original of the scene in Macbeth where he is putting on his armour and news is brought him of his wife's death, -and an engraving of the meeting of Macbeth with the witches. Also a water colour sketch by Thorwaldsen of Dante and Virgil descending into the Inferno, an admirable engraving of Albert Dilrer's and a portrait of old Nicolai by Graf. G. was enraptured with a lovely engraving of the ""Triumph of Gala tea"". On leaving Dr. Parthey's we went to the old Museum to look atthe sculpture. Two Reposing Fawns, a Jupiter and an Apollo, the most remarkable things in the Rotunde. In the evening we went to see Do ring's Shylock which was unmitigatedly bad. Friday and Saturday I was suffering again from my head. In the evening, however, I finished my article and yesterday (Sunday 4th) sent it to London. We walked with Dessoir in the Thiergarten and enjoyed the delicious, springlike day. In the evening I read Macaulay and wrote an article to G's dictation on Brodie's Psychological Inquiries. Today (Monday) we walked in the Thiergarten and went to Count
Raczinsky's Picture Gallery-a very interesting collection which we mean to visit again. Kaulbach's Hunnen Schlacht and Deutsche Sage. Group of Italians outside St. Peter's by De La Roche. Sons of Edward IV by Hildebrand. In the evening Dessoir came and read Hamlet. G. acted Shylock."
Diary 1954-1861,1855-03-06,46,71,N/A,Tuesday 6. Wrote to Varnhagen and Magnus.

Diary 1954-1861,1855-03-08,47,72,N/A,"Thursday 8. Went to the Wagner Gallery; a collection of pictures by modern German artists. The only things that interested us at all were: a group of fishermen, one of whom is recounting to a fisherman's wife the story of her husband's wreck, by Jordan, an infant Christ by Hübner, a landscape by Lessing, a slave merchant with his human wares by Horace Vernet, St. Catherine carried
to her grave by Angels by Miicke, and some clever Wilkie-like pictures by
Hasenclever, one of them a news-room lighted with gas with readers
surrounding a table. From thence we went to the Old Museum and looked at the Sculpture. It is interesting to see the statue of Napoleon who worked so much woe to Prussia placed opposite that ofJulius Cæsar. We saw a beautiful Hebe of Canova's for the first time. Went into the picture gallery to have a parting look at
Titian's daughter and the Correggios. Came home and packed the books. Read Macaulay. Walked out and afterwards translated and wrote for G."

Diary 1954-1861,1855-03-15,54,79,N/A,"Thursday. 15. A lovely day. As I walked up the Castle hill this afternoon the
town with its background of softly rounded hills shrouded in sleepy haze, its little lines of water looking golden in the sun, made a charming picture. I have written the Preface to the third Book ofEthics, read Scherr and Shakspeare's Venus and Adonis."
Diary 1954-1861,1855-03-16,54,79,N/A,"Friday 16. A still lovelier day. A brisk wind carried about great masses of cloud below an arch of clear blue. I read Shakspeare's ""Passionate Pilgrim"" at breakfast and found a sonnet in which he expresses admiration of Spenser ( Sonnet VIII)
""Douland to thee is dear, whose heavenly touch
Upon the lute doth ravish human sense:
Spenser to me, whose deep conceit is such,
As passing all conceit needs no defence.""
I must send word of this to G. who has written in his Goethe that Shakspeare has left no line in praise ofa contemporary. [insertelda ter:(G . writes that this sonnet is Barnwell's )) I could not resist the temptation of walking out before I sat down to work. Came in at 1/2 past 10 and translated Spinoza till nearly 1. Walked out again till 2. After dinner read ""Two Gentlemen ofVerona"" and some of the ""Sonnets"". That play disgusted me more than ever in the final scene where Valentine on Proteus' mere begging pardon where he has no longer any hope of gaining his ends, says: ""All that was mine in Silvia I give thee""! -Silvia standing by. Walked up the Castle hill again and came in at 6. Read Scherr and found an important hint that I have made a mistake in a sentence of my article on Austria about the death of Franz von Sickingen.

Diary 1954-1861,1856-05-08,59-60,84-85,N/A,"May 8. Set off in very cold weather for Ilfracomb [sic]. Staid an hour at Windsor on our way, and walked round the Castle. Reached Bristol about half past six and having two hours to stay before starting for Exeter, we walked through the
narrow dirty streets to St. Mary Redcliff, the old church where Chatterton pretended to have found the Rowley MS. It is a remarkably fine old church. After looking at this we walked some distance along the road by the side of the river, but being both headachy, we were soon glad to turn back to the station and wait in the rather dirty room there till the Express set offfor Exeter. We reached the Exeter Station (which is about a mile from the town), at ten, and were delighted to find a comfortable bedroom there, which saved our going to the town. We breakfasted at half past eight, and then strolled out in glorious sunshine to look at the town and Cathedral. A pretty, quiet road led us very soon to the upper part of the town - by handsome almshouses on one side and parklike grounds on the other to the principal street, where we noticed the market, and a fine bit of very old building now used as the Station House (Police). We made our way to the Cathedral which stands in a fine open space with tall trees round it. The two square towers individualize it among Cathedrals. We had a peep through the open door which gave me the idea of a grand interior. Back
again to the station and away by the train to Barnstaple, the country through which we passed charmingly undulated and wooded. At Barnstaple we got into the Ilfracombe coach- or rather I got in and G got outside, making on our way the acquaintance ofa family named Webster, who have since taken part of the same house with us here- Runnymeade Villa."

Saw some splendid anemones, beyond anything I had imagined of that kind, some Eolids and Corallines. We were pleased with his nice daughter, who seems to take a real interest in the animals quite apart from commercial considerations."
Diary 1954-1861,1856-05-[15],60,85,N/A,"Thursday. G. called on Mr. Tugwell, the curate here, whom he found a charming young man, the author of various books - a Guide to North Devon etc."
Diary 1954-1861,1856-05-15,60-61,85-86,N/A,"Thursday 15. Mr Tugwell returned the call. In the afternoon we walked to Lee, a delicious spot in a deep hollow between two magnificent hills. The steep sides ofone of these hills are hung with low woods, or with masses of furze now in full bloom. The primroses here quite cover the sides of some of the hills as well as the banks of the lanes. Not the least beautiful things we saw were the springs by the roadside, crystally clear, decked with liverwort and fern. We returned by a different way- through Slade, which we were told was only half a mile longer, but we found ourselves in an interminable road over the hills , and at length came to a spot where two directions seemed equally promising or unpromising of Ilfracomb. We took one, however, in the necessity of a choice and walked on and on without seeing any indication of our being in the right direction , till at last we came to a farm-house, where G. made inquiries and found that we were in the right road, but had still two miles to walk. We got home a little before six, after walking three hours and a half, and were thoroughly knocked up. In the last mile we passed a lovely hill where the rich colour of the marly soil made a beautiful contrast with the bright green pastures and the masses of furze. - In the evenings I have been reading Masson's Essays - ""The Three Devils"" and chatterton's Life-and this evening I have read some of Trench's Calderon."
Diary 1954-1861,1856-05-20,61,86,N/A,"Tuesday 20. After writing an hour, we went out with Mr. Tugwell zoologizing, and thanks to his aid and exertions brought home a rich store of Actinia Crassicornis and other precious but less conspicuous things."
Diary 1954-1861,1856-05-24,61,86,N/A,Saturday 24. My article on Riehl is rather more than half done. I have had a letter from Chrissey today telling me that Charlie is elected for the Medical College.

Diary 1954-1861,1856-06-27,61,86,N/A,"Friday 27. Took our lodgings and unpacked. I was quite knocked up by my yesterday's journey, and the exertions of this morning. The weather bright, and the air perfect."
Diary 1954-1861,1856-06-28,61,86,N/A,"Saturday 28. We had a glorious hunt this morning in the caverns of St.
Catherine's Rock. Found some specimens of the Alcyonium Digitatum, the Clavellina and the Stag's Horn Polype as well as abundance of Laomedea: and Actiniæ."
Diary 1954-1861,1856-06-29,61,86,N/A,"Sunday 29. Wrote to Sara Rennell, Barbara Smith and Mrs. Croft. In the
afternoon we had a delicious walk in the sunshine towards Gilbar Point , and saw for the first time a Lop hi us, or Fishing Frog. It was about three feet long and had been cast dead upon the sands. Presently after we saw a Rhizostoma nearly a foot in diameter, also cast on the sands."
Diary 1954-1861,1856-06-30,62,87,N/A,"30. We went hunting this morning in the cove on the north side of St.
Catherine's, and found some polypes and sea weed, with which we were not familiar. We were both terribly tired and so did not attempt any long walk. I am reading in the evenings the Memoirs ofBeaumarchais and Milne
Edwards's Zoology. G. has begun to read Coriolanus aloud."
Diary 1954-1861,1856-07-05,62,87,N/A,"Sat. July 5. We have hunted two or three times in St. Catherine's caverns this week, and have found in addition to former spoils, a solitary Ascidian, two Eolids, and a specimen of Cellularia Avicularia, in which the Birds' heads were very active while the rest of the Polype appeared dead. The weather has been delicious every day, but G. having hurt his foot, we have not been able to take long walks. I have continued reading Milne Edwards aloud, and have also read
Harriet Martineau's article on Missions in the Westminster, and one or two articles in the National. Reading to myselfHarvey's Sea-side Book, and ""The Lovers' Seat""."
Diary 1954-1861,1856-07-06,62,87,N/A,"Sunday. July 6. The sun shines beautifully this morning, but we are rather depressed because G.'s head seems worse."
Diary 1954-1861,1856-07-20,62,87,N/A,"Sunday. July 20. Since I made the last note in my journal, I have had the comfort of seeing G. much better. The fortnight has slipped away without my being able to show much result from it. I have written a review of the ""Lover's Seat"" for the ""Leader"", and jotted down some recollections of llfracombe; besides these trifles and the introduction to an article already written, I have done no visible work. But I have absorbed many ideas and much bodily strength; indeed, I do not remember ever feeling so strong in mind and body as I feel at this moment. 

On Saturday, the 12th, Barbara Smith arrived and staid here till Wednesday
morning. We enjoyed her society ':ery much, but were deeply touched to see that three years had made her so much older and sadder. Her activity for great objects is admirable, and contact with her is a fresh inspiration to work while it is day. On Tuesday evening she came to tell us ofher interview with her ""Aunt Patty"" - a scene beyond the conception of Moliere. We parted from her at the door of the ""Co burg"" at about 1/2 past 11.

In the meantime G. has been very industrious and has written a sea-side
article for Blackwood, which was sent off yesterday. I have been reading aloud the Memoirs ofBeaumarchais which yielded me little fruit, continued Milne Edwards, and have now taken up Quatrefageasg ain. 

Mr. Chapman invites me to contribute to the Westminster for this quarter.
I am anxious to begin my fiction writing and so am not inclined to undertake an article that will give me much trouble, but at all events I will finish my article on Young."
Diary 1954-1861,1856-07-21,62,87,N/A,"Monday 21. We had a delightful walk on the North Sands and hunted with success. A sunny, happy day."
Diary 1954-1861,1856-07-28,62-63,87-88,N/A,"Monday 28. Mr. Pigott arrived at last, after various processes of expectation and disappointment. We drove to Lidstep in the afternoon. Yesterday I had a letter from Chrissey, which I answered today. I have engaged to write an article for the next w. R. on ""Silly Women's Novels""."
Diary 1954-1861,1856-08-02,63,88,N/A,"Sat. Aug. 2. Last evening we saw Mr. Pigott's Yacht sail in and cast anchor, and this morning we went on board. This evening G. and I have been out in a boat for an hour, and have caught about 20 Medusa:. The western light on the rippled water as we went out was glorious, and on our return we saw the lovely green phosphorescence about the net and the oars."
Diary 1954-1861,1856-08-03,63,88,N/A,"Sunday. 3. I went out to the Castle Hill after breakfast this morning, and the Yacht was gone. So we are once more quiet and alone."

I wrote to Sara, also, this morning telling her my impressions from her book just published- ""Christianity and Infidelity""."
Diary 1954-1861,1857-03-15,66,91,N/A,"March 15. Sunday evening. We set off on our journey, at 9 o'clock, and slept at the Paddington Station."
Diary 1954-1861,1857-03-16,66,91,N/A,"16. Travelled by express from London to Plymouth. It was a delicious sunshiny day, and I enjoyed the simple English landscape in the early part of our way the little willow-bordered streams, blue as sapphires, the soft brown uplands, and the villages with their tiled roofs, yellow and olive-coloured in the sunlight, from their coating oflichen. We reached Plymouth a little after five, and went to the Globe Hotel, from which the Truro coachs tarts. Before our Thé dinatoire we walked to the Hoe and saw the Harbour, the breakwater, and Drake's island. Plymouth is a cheerful, clean place, with the finest site I remember to have seen for a sea-port, except Genoa."
Diary 1954-1861,1857-03-17,66-67,91-92,N/A,"17. We set offby coach to Truro at 10 1/2 under a cloudy sky. We had the back places outside, and, hard seats excepted, a very agreeable journey. Our travelling companions were a stout elderly gentleman who had travelled a great deal, bald and benevolent; an old Scotch sailor, who had come over in the vessel where the drunken captain had flogged a boy to death, and who was now travelling from Dundee to Penzance, to give his evidence in the captain's trial; a pretentious, vulgar young man with smart clothes, dirty nails, and original information on physiology; and, for part of the way, a Devonshire lass who shook hands with us all round at parting, and a Devonshire lad with scarlet flowered plush waistcoat and yellow and flowered silk neckerchief, who ate buns industriously from the time we started till his large stock was exhausted. The old sailor was a fine specimen of a simple, brave, kind-hearted man -a natural gentleman. For part of our way, until after we reached Bodmin, the country was charming- clear, rushing, winding streams, great hills, their sides clothed with woods hoary with grey lichen, and deep valleys which the unfinished railway spanned with its viaducts. But by and bye we got into the dreariest scenery of Cornwall: treeless, rough wastes, the relics of former mines; works for the preparation of the white clay used in making porcelain, where the chief objects were hovels for packing the blocks of dried, purified clay, as white as chalk, and oblong tanks where the clay is put to be purified; and throughout all this region of mines and clay works, the streams are thick and coloured or else milky white. At St. Austel, where there is a fine church tower, we got inside,
and found an intelligent companion, who told us something of the miners and their customs. At St. Probus, a little village through which we passsed, there is another exquisite church tower, but the landscape all the way is bare and dreary. It was nearly dark when we reached Truro and exchanged our stage coach for the railway. We arrived terribly weary at Penzance, about half past eight."
Diary 1954-1861,1857-03-18,67,92,N/A,"18. The morning was so dismal - the rain pouring down and the wind reported to be 'due west' - that we gave up our voyage to the Scilly Isles, and persisted in spite of the Captain's testimony to the good character of the wind. When the rain abated we set out to look for lodgings and, owing apparently to the glorious freedom of our will, chose the worst. However, we spent the evening pleasantly, in spite of ailing bodies, reading Mrs. Gaskell's pretty Cranford."
Diary 1954-1861,1857-03-19,67,92,N/A,"19. This morning the sun shines again, and we have sat down to our desks in home fashion. Reading, in the evening, ""Poor Peter""."
Diary 1954-1861,1857-03-20,67,92,N/A,"20. I was not well enough to take a long walk yesterday, but today, we went to Marazion, the pretty, clean village opposite St. Michael's Mount. The day was not bright; still, the view of the mount was beautiful - its graceful pyramidal form finely crowned by the irregular outline of the old castle."
Diary 1954-1861,1857-03-21,67,92,N/A,"21. Today we found a charming walk inland, along roads bordered with clear, rushing streams, avenues of elms here and there, and stone built banks under the hedge-rows. Began ""The Scarlet Letter""."
Diary 1954-1861,1857-03-22,67,92,N/A,"22. Sunday. A sunny day. We had a glorious walk, that reminded us of
Ilfracombe - the roads leading over hills from which we had a view of other, distant hills, purple with the shadows of the many clouds that floated in the blue sky. I noticed the bright red tips of the trees which were most abundant in the hedge-rows, and we learned from a Cornish man, in his Sunday clothes, whose appearance promised us ""good civility"" that these trees were the ""Cornish Elm""."
Diary 1954-1861,1857-03-23,67,92,N/A,"23. So calm today, we could not hear the waves from our room in the morning. The sea is smooth as a lake. But there have been some hail showers, and the air is sharp. We had a delicious walk in the afternoon, clear running brooks everywhere; road-side carpeted with the heart shaped leaves of the celandine, the
golden flowers peeping up here and there. I began to read Miss Catlow's Botany."
Diary 1954-1861,1857-03-25,67,92,N/A,"25. Packed up last night, hoping to cross to Scilly this morning, but the wind was against us, so we spent a loitering day."
Diary 1954-1861,1857-03-26,67-68,92-93,N/A,"26. We were called at six this morning to go on board the Ariadne. There was
a delicious light from the lately risen sun over the waters and St. Michael's
Mount, and the first minutes on board were very enjoyable, but we soon went below out of the rain and were glad to lie down in our berths. After a 6 hours' voyage which in spite of illness, seemed short, we landed on St Mary's, got comfortable lodgings at the Post Office, and went out on the hill to look at the lovely prospect- the blue sea breaking in white foam against little violetcoloured
islands."
Diary 1954-1861,1857-04-08,68,93,N/A,"April 8th. Since I made the last entry in my journal we have had many delicious walks and seen many beautiful sights - on clear days the smaller islands with their lovely colouring specking the blue sea, the white foam prancing round them; on more sombre days the grand rocky coast of the southern side of St. Mary's - Peninis, the Giant's Castle etc. Or we have walked over the furze and heath clad hills and heard the air ringing with larks.

Since we came here Chrissey has lost her pretty little Fanny, and I am still
waiting anxiously for news of Katy and herself- both ill off ever when I last
heard. News, too, has come from Barbara in Algiers - the probability of her marrying Dr. Bodichon, a French army physician. 

Today I have finished ""Mr. Gilfil's Love Story"". We are reading Carlyle's Cromwell and Aurora Leigh again in the evenings. I am still in the Ædipus Tyrannus, with Shelley's poems, and snatches of Natural History."
Diary 1954-1861,1857-04-18,68,93,N/A,"8th. A letter from my brother this evening tells me that Chrissey and her Katy are better, but not yet out of danger."

Diary 1954-1861,1857-04-11,68,93,N/A,"11. Headache again, but went out for a glorious hunt on the rocks. No letter about Chrissey."
Diary 1954-1861,1857-04-16,68,93,N/A,"16. No letter again. The weather has been cold and dreary and I have been

Tonight we finished Aurora Leigh for the second time."

Love Story. He writes very pleasantly, says the Series is attributed by many to Bulwer, and that Thackeray thinks highly ofit. This was a pleasant fillip to me, who am just now ready to be dispirited on the slightest pretext."

The other day we had a pleasant letter from Spencer saying that he had heard ""Mr Gilfil's Love Story"" discussed by Baynes and Dallas, as well as previously by Pigott, all expressing warm approval, and curiosity as to the author.

Diary 1954-1861,1857-06-22,69,94,N/A,"June 22. My mind has been too intensely agitated and occupied during the last three weeks, for me to have energy left to make entries in my journal, though I have often been regretting that the days pass by without registering the beauties we see in our walks. In the interim I have had an interesting correspondence with Blackwood, have received a letter from Mr. Holbeche inquiring about my marriage, and have given him a full and explicit answer, have had letters from my sisters and from Rosehill and have been writing my second part of""Janet"". The wild flowers are in great beauty just now, and I notice that everything is earlier here than in the calendars for England. The walks are endless and all enchanting, though for the last week or so we have enjoyed them less because of the harsh east winds. A letter from Barbara, received long after it was written announced to us that she was to be married on the 15th of this month."

Diary 1954-1861,1857-11-28,70-71,95-96,N/A,"Nov. 28. A glorious day, still autumnal and not wintry. We have had a delicious walk in the park and I think the colouring of the scenery is more beautiful than ever. Many of the oaks are still thickly covered with leaves of a rich yellow brown; the elms golden, sometimes still with lingering patches of green. On our way to the Park, the view from Richmond hill had a delicate blue mist over it that seemed to hang like a veil before the sober brownish yellow of the distant elms. As we came home, the sun was setting on a fog-bank and we saw him sink into that purple ocean. The orange and gold passing into green above the fogbank-the gold and orange reflected in the river in more sober tints.

The other day as we were coming home through the park after having walked under a sombre, heavily clouded sky, the westering sun shone out from under the curtain, and lit up the trees and grass, thrown into relief on a background of dark purple cloud. Then as we advanced towards the Richmond end of the park the level reddening rays shone on the dry fern and the distant oaks and threw a crimson light on them. I have especially enjoyed this autumnthe delicious greenness of the turfin contrast with the red and yellow of the dying leaves."
Diary 1954-1861,1857-12-06,71,96,N/A,"Sunday, Dec. 6. Finished the Agamemnon today. In the evenings of late, we have been reading Harriet Martineau's sketch of The British Empire in India, and are now following it up with Macaulay's articles of Clive and Hastings. We have lately read H. M.'s Introduction to the History of the Peace and have begun the History of the Thirty Years' Peace."
Diary 1954-1861,1857-12-08,71,96,N/A,"8. We have been reading the last two evenings, the Christmas number of
Household Words - ""Perils of certain English Prisoners"" - by Wilkie Collins and Dickens. I am reading ""Die Familie"" by Riehl, forming the third volume of the series, the two first of which ""Land und Volk"" and ""Die Bürgerliche Gesellschaft"", I reviewed for the Westminster."
Diary 1954-1861,1857-12-10,71,96,N/A,10. Major Blackwood called - an unaffected agreeable man. It was evident to us when he had only been in the room a few minutes that he knew I was George Eliot.
Diary 1954-1861,1857-12-17,71,96,N/A,"Thursday. 17. Read my new story to G. this evening as far as the end of the third chapter. He praised it highly. I have finished ""Die Familie"" by Riehl, a delightful book. I am in the Choephora: now. In the evenings we are reading History of Thirty Years' Peace and Beranger. Thoroughly disappointed in Béranger."
Diary 1954-1861,1857-12-19,71,96,N/A,"Dec. 19. Saturday. Alone this evening, with very thankful solemn thoughts -
feeling the great and unhoped for blessings that have been given me in life. This last year especially has been marked by inward progress and outward advantages. In the Spring, George's History of Philosophy appeared in the New Edition - his Sea-side Studies have been written with much enjoyment and met with much admiration and now they are on the verge of being published, with bright prospects. Blackwood has also accepted his Physiology of Common Life; the 'Goethe' has passed into its third German edition; and best of all, G's head is well. I have written the Scenes of Clerical Life - my first book - and though we are uncertain still whether it will be a success as a separate publication, I have had much sympathy from my readers in Blackwood, and feel a deep
satisfaction in having done a bit of faithful work that will perhaps remain like a primrose root in the hedgerow and gladden and chasten human hearts in years to come."
Diary 1954-1861,1857-12-25,71,96,N/A,"Christmas Day. George and I spent this lovely day together- lovely as a clear
Spring day. We could see Hampstead from the park so distinctly that it seemed to have suddenly come nearer to us. We ate our turkey together in a happy 'solitude á deux'."
Diary 1954-1861,1857-12-26,72,97,N/A,Sat. Dec. 26. G. set out today at 12 o'clock for Vernon Hill for a week's holiday.
Diary 1954-1861,1857-12-31,72,97,N/A,"Dec. 31. The last night of 1857. The dear old year is gone with all its Webena nd
Streben.1 Yet not gone, either; for what I have suffered and enjoyed in it remains
to me an everlasting possession while my soul's life remains. This time last year I
was alone, as I am now, and dear George was at Vernon Hill. I was writing the
Introduction to Mr. Gilfil's Love Story. What a world of thoughts and feelings
since then! My life has deepened unspeakably during the last year: I feel a
greater capacity for moral and intellectual enjoyment, a more acute sense of my
deficencies in the past, a more solemn desire to be faithful to coming duties,
than I remember at any former period of my life. And my happiness has
deepened too: the blessedness of a perfect love and union grows daily. I have had
some severe suffering this year from anxiety about my sister and what will
probably be a final separation from her- there has been no other real trouble.
Few women, I fear have had such reason as I have to think the long sad years of
youth were worth living for the sake of middle age.
Our prospects are very bright, too. I am writing my new novel. G. is full ofhis
""Physiology of Common Life"" which Blackwood has accepted with cordial
satisfaction; and the first part, on ""Hunger and Thirst"" appears in the January
No. of Maga. He has just finished editing Johnston for which he is to have 100
guineas. And we have both encouragement to think that our books just coming
out- ""Sea-side Studies"" and ""Scenes of Clerical Life"" will be well received.
So goodbye, dear 1857! May I be able to look back on 1858 with an equal
consciousness of advancement in work and in heart.

excursion, the morning being brilliant. We went to Windsor, but the cold was so bitter that we were glad to return home at half past two, after walking along the great avenue towards the Forest, and seeing the Royal Chapel. The Chapel is not satisfactory to the eye, from the flatness of the roof."

Martineau's History last night after reading some hundred pages in the second volume. She has a sentimental, rhetorical style in this history which is fatiguing and not instructive.But her history of the Reform Movement is very interesting. G. has finished The Excursion, which repaid us for going to the end by an occasional fine passage even to the last. He has now begun the other poems of Wordsworth. This morning I finished the Eumenides. Wrote to Barbara, 79, East Fifteenth Street, New York. Bessie Parkes has written to me wishing me to
contribute to the ""English Woman's Journal"", a new monthly which, she says, ""We are beginning with a £1000 and great social interest""."

We reached Dresden, I think, on the 18th of July, and remained there until the 30th of August. We staid two nights at Leipsic on our way home, where we arrived on the night of Sep. 2nd.

in another book."

I may also note, by way of dating the conclusion of an acquaintance extending over eight years, that I have received no answer from Dr. Chapman to my letter of the 5th, and have learned from Mr. Spencer that the circumstances attending this silence are not more excusable than I had
imagined them to be. I shall not correspond with him or willingly see him again."
Diary 1954-1861,1858-12-25,75,100,N/A,"Christmas Day. George and I spent this wet day very happily alone together.

unexpected happiness. Adam Bede has been written , and the second vol. is in
type. The first No. of George's ""Physiology of Common Life"" - a work in which
he has had much happy occupation - is published to-day, and both his position
as a scientific writer and his inward satisfaction in that bent ofhis studies have
been much heightened during the past year. Our double life is more and more
blessed- more and mor e complete.

Diary 1954-1861,1859-02-22,76,101,N/A,"22. Today G. went into town and brought home the news that ""Adam Bede"" was moving, but at the same time said other things which depressed me. I am saddened and discouraged with life- perhaps from physical ailments and household annoyances."
Diary 1954-1861,1859-02-24,76,101,N/A,"24. Pleasant news from Edinburgh about Adam Bede: that Mr. Caird admires it and had forgotten time in reading it. Letter of warm acknowledgment from Mrs.
Carlyle, and one from Dr. John Brown. Good news, too, about the Physiology of Common Life: the first No. having sold near upon 6000, the second 5000."

Diary 1954-1861,1859-04-27,77,102,N/A,"27. Resumed my new novel, of which I am going to rewrite the two first
chapters. I shall call it provisionally, ""The Tullivers"", for the sake of a title
quelconque - or perhaps, ""St. Ogg's on the Floss""."
Diary 1954-1861,1859-05-02,77,102,N/A,"May 2. G. and I went into town. He saw Simon, who examined him with the stethoscope, and declared him to be quite free from organic disease. This is a great blessing to me, for last week he fainted in his dressing-room, without any previous complaint of malaise, and since then I had been doubly anxious about him."
Diary 1954-1861,1859-05-03,77,102,N/A,"May 3. I had a letter from Mrs. Richard Congreve telling me ofher safe arrival with her husband and sister at Dieppe. This new friend whom I have gained by coming to Wandsworth, is the chief charm of the place to me. Her friendship has the same date as the success of Adam Bede - two good things in my lot that
ought to have made me less sad than I have been in this house."
Diary 1954-1861,1859-05-09,77,102,N/A,"May 9. George and I had a delicious drive to Dulwich, and back by Sydenham.
We staid an hour in the gallery at Dulwich, and I satisfied myself that the St.
Sebastian is no exception to the usual ""petty prettiness"" ofGuido's conceptions.
The Cuyp glowing in the evening sun, the Spanish Beggar boys of Murillo, and
Gains borough's portrait of Mrs. Sheridan and her sister are the gems of the
gallery. But better than the pictures was the fresh greenth of the Spring- the
chestnuts just on the verge of their flowering beauty, the bright leaves of the
limes, the rich yellow-brown of the oaks, the meadows full ofbuttercups. We
saw for the first time, Clapham Common, Streatham Common, and Tooting
Common - the two last like parks rather than Commons.
My Journal is continued at the opposite end, by mistake, as a continuation of
the History of Adam Bede."
Diary 1954-1861,1859-06-01,77,102,N/A,June 1. At p. 85 of my new novel.

I told them I was the author of Adam Bede and Clerical Scenes, and they seemed overwhelmed with surprize. This experience has enlightened me a good deal as to the ignorance in which we all live of each other."

Diary 1954-1861,1859-07-10,78,103,N/A,"10. Sunday. We spent a delightful day in Paris, in spite of heat and headache. To the Louvre first, where we looked chiefly at the Marriage at Cana, by Paul Veronese. This picture, the greatest I have seen ofhis, converted me to high admiration ofhim. Next, we took a carriage and drove to the Bois de Boulogne, getting down on our return at the Palais de l'Industrie, where we saw poor statues, and took abominable ices. Afterwards we strolled in the Palais Royale and looked at the shops, took a carriage in the evening along the Boulevards, and so passed the time till we went to the railway, on which we were to journey through the night to Strasburg."

Diary 1954-1861,1859-07-12,78,103,N/A,"12. Up at five and on the railway to Lucerne. Much relieved by the cooler
morning air, and able to look out on the landscape with some enjoyment the latter part of the way. A broadchested man, with coloured tickets stuck out round his hat came into our carriage: he was to be one of the competing shooters with the rifle at the approaching Zurich festival, and had purchased these tickets at a high price, as a sign of the right to shoot for as many prizes. At 9 or 10 o'clock we got to Lucerne, glad to make a home at the charming Schweizerhof on the banks of the lake. G. went to call on the Congreves, and in the afternoon Mrs. Congreve came to chat with us. In the evening we had a boat on the Lake."
Diary 1954-1861,1859-07-13,78,103,N/A,"13. Wednesday. G. set off for Hofwyl at five o'clock, and the days were passed by me, till his return on Saturday, in quiet chats with the Congreves and quiet resting on my own sofa."

Diary 1954-1861,1859-08-25,79-80,104-105,N/A,"25. In the evening of this day we set off on our journey to Penmaenmawr. We reached Conway at 1/2 past 3 in the morning, and finding that it was hopeless to get a bed anywhere, we walked about the town till the morning began to dawn and we could see the outline of the fine old castle and battlemented walls. In the morning we went to Llandudno, thinking that might suit us better than Penmaenmawr. We found it ugly and fashionable. Then we went off to Penmaenmawr which was beautiful to our hearts' content- or rather discontent; for it would not receive us, being already filled with visitors. Back again in despair to Conway, where we got temporary lodgings at one of the numerous Jones's. This particular Jones happened to be honest and obliging and we did well enough for a few days in our indoor life, but out of doors there were cold winds and rain. One day we went to Abergele, and found a solitary house called Beach House, which it seemed possible we might have at the end
of a few days. But no! and the winds were so cold on this northerly coast that George was not sorry, preferring rather to take flight southward. So we set out again on the 31st and reached Lichfield about 1/2 past 5. Here we meant to pass the night, that I might see my nieces - dear Chrissey's orphan children - Emily and Kate. I was much comforted by the sight of them, looking happy, and apparently under excellent care, in Miss Eborall's school. We slept at the Swan,
where I remember being with my father and mother when I was a little child, and afterwards with my father alone in our last journey into Derbyshire. The next morning we set off again and accomplished our journey to Weymouth. Here again we found difficulty in getting lodgings, this being the fullest moment of the season, but at last we settled ourselves at 39, East Street, with
some good Wesleyans, honest and kind. Many delicious walks and happy hours we had in our fortnight there. A letter from Mr. Langford informed us that the subscription for the 6th edition of Adam Bede was 1000. Another pleasant incident was a letter from my old friend and schoolfellow Martha Jackson, asking if the authorof Adam Bede was her Marian Evans."
Diary 1954-1861,1859-09-16,80,105,N/A,"Friday Sep. 16. We reached home about 4 o'clock, and found letters awaiting us - one from Mr. Quirk, finally renouncing Liggins!-with tracts of an ultra-evangelical kind for me, and the Parish Mag. etc. -from the Rev. Erskine Clark of St. Michaels, Derby, who had written to me to ask me to help him in this sort of work."
Diary 1954-1861,1859-09-18,80,105,N/A,"Sunday 18. A volume of devotional poetry from the authoress of""Visiting my Relations"", with an inscription admonishing me not to be beguiled by the love of money: In much anxiety and doubt about my new novel."
Diary 1954-1861,1859-10-07,80,105,N/A,"October 7. Since the last entry in my journal, various matters ofinterest have occurred. Certain new ideas have occurred to me in relation to my novel and I am in better hope ofit. At Weymouth I had written to Blackwood to ask him about terms supposing I published in Maga. His answer, offering me £3000 for publishing in Maga and four years' copyright, determined me to decline. On Monday the 26th we set out on a three days' journey to Lincolnshire and back - 'very pleasant and successful both as to weather and the objects I was in search of. A less pleasant business has been a correspondence with a crétin named
Bracebridge, a Warwickshire Magistrate who undertakes to declare the process by which I wrote my books - and who is the chief propagator and maintainer of the story that Liggins is at the bottom of the Clerical Scenes and Adam Bede. It is poor George who has had to conduct the correspondence, making his head hot by it, to the exclusion of more fructifying work. Today in answer to a letter from
Sara, I have written her an account of my interviews with my Aunt Samuel. This evening comes a letter from Miss Brewster: full of well-meant exhortation."
Diary 1954-1861,1859-10-16,80-81,105-106,N/A,"16. Sunday. Yesterday, as I lay in bed ill from the exertion of walking about in the Zoological gardens, whither we went for the sake of George's health, came a pleasant packet ofletters: one from Blackwood saying that they are printing a seventh edition of Adam Bede ( of 2000 ), and that Clerical Scenes will soon be exhausted, and an anonymous letter asking me for a sequel to ""Adam"", telling all about Hetty, the silk handkerchief and the locket and earrings! I have finished the first volume of my new Novel, ""Sister Maggie"", have got my legal
questions answered satisfactorily, and when my headache has cleared off must go at it full speed."
Diary 1954-1861,1859-10-25,81,106,N/A,"Tuesday 25. The day before yesterday Herbert Spencer dined with us, and there was talk- for the last time, I hope- about my books. We have made a resolution that we will allow no more talk in our own house on the subject. Ifind it destructive of that repose and simplicity of mind which is the only healthy state in relation to one's books: it has the same effect as talking of one's religion, or one's feelings and duties towards one's father, mother, or husband. 

We have just finished reading aloud ""Pére Go riot"" - a hateful book. This evening I am at p. 31 of my 2nd vol. 

 I have been reading lately and have nearly finished Comte's Catechism. We have also read aloud ""Tom Brown's School Days"" with much disappointment.It is an unpleasant, unveracious book."
Diary 1954-1861,1859-10-28,81,106,N/A,"Friday 28. Received from Blackwood a cheque for £400, the last payment for
Adam Bede in the terms of the agreement. But in consequence of the great success, he proposes to pay me £Soo more at the beginning of next year. Yesterday Smith the publisher called, to make propositions to G. about writing in the Cornhill Magazine."
Diary 1954-1861,1859-11-10,81,106,N/A,"November. 10. Dickens dined with us today, for the first time, and after he left I went to the Congreves', where George joined me and we had much chat- about George Stephenson, religion etc."
Diary 1954-1861,1859-11-11,81,106,N/A,"11. I received today a charming letter from Mrs. Gaskell, in which she says
""Since I heard, from authority, that you were the author of""Scenes of Clerical Life"" and ""Adam Bede"", I have read them again; and I must, once more, tell you how earnestly, fully, and humbly I admire them. I never read anything so complete and beautiful in fiction, in my life before"". Very sweet and noble of her!- I have been very poorly almost all this week, and sticking terribly in the mud so far as my writing is concerned."
Diary 1954-1861,1859-11-18,81,106,N/A,"18. On Monday, Dickens wrote asking me to give him, after I have finished
my present novel, a story to be printed in ""All the Year round"" -to begin four months after next Easter, and assuring me of my own terms. The next day G. had an interview by appointment with Evans ( of Bradbury and Evans) and Lucas, the editor of ""Once a week"", who after preliminary pressing of G. himself to contribute, put forward their wish that I should give them a novel for their Magazine, promising higher terms than Blackwood would give. They were to
write and make an offer, but have not yet done so. We have written to Dickens saying that Time is an insurmountable obstacle to his proposition as he puts it. - Today G. has been into town again to see the attorney, Mr. Sheard, about our
wills. - I am reading Thomas á Kemp is."

Diary 1954-1861,1859-11-20,82,107,N/A,"Sunday 20. A headache this morning induced us to give up work and walk in
Richmond Park, where there is still much beauty of tint from the red brown of the ferns and the yellow elm leaves. George called at Professor Owen's, and I walked home alone. We are reading aloud Huber's History of Bees, and the Life of Charlotte Bronte for the second time."
Diary 1954-1861,1859-11-21,82,107,N/A,"21. Mr. Sheard brought our Wills for signature, and I consulted him about the legal affairs of my novel."
Diary 1954-1861,1859-11-22,82,107,N/A,"22. We have been much annoyed lately by Newby's advertisement ofa book called ""Adam Bede,Junior, a Sequel"", and today Dickens has written to mention a story of the tricks which are being used to push the book underthe pretence of its being mine. One Librarian has been forced to order the book against his will, because the public have demanded it! Dickens is going to put an article on the subject in Household Words, in order to scarify the rascally bookseller. The Blackwoods are slow to act in the matter- hitherto, have not acted at all: not being strongly moved, apparently by what is likely to injure me more than them. Several persons have expressed their surprize at the silence of the Blackwoods."
Diary 1954-1861,1859-11-23,82,107,N/A,"23. We began Darwin's work on ""The Origin of Species"" tonight. It seems not to be well written: though full ofinteresting matter, it is not impressive, from want of luminous and orderly presentation."
Diary 1954-1861,1859-11-24,82,107,N/A,"24. This morning I wrote the scene between Mrs. Tulliver and Wakem. G. went into town, and saw Young Evans ( of Bradbury and Evans), who agreed that it would be well to have an article in Punch on this scoundrelly business of""Adam Bede, Junior"". A divine day! I walked out and Mrs Congreve joined me. Then music, Arabian Nights, and Darwin."
Diary 1954-1861,1859-11-25,82,107,N/A,"25. Not having been quite pleased with Blackwood's behaviour oflate, I have written to have a clear understanding from him whether he wishes to continue to be my publisher. - I am reading old Bunyan again after the long lapse of years,
and am profoundly struck with the true genius manifested in the simple,
vigorous, rhythmic style."
Diary 1954-1861,1859-11-26,82,107,N/A,"26. Letter from Lucas, editor of ""Once a week"", anxious to come to terms about my writing for said periodical. The three boys have all written us charming letters this week."

From Bern we brought our eldest boy Charles, to begin a new period in his life, after four years at Hofwyl. During our absence ""The Mill on the Floss"" has come out and achieved a greater success than I had ever hoped for it. The subscription
was 3600 (the number originally printed was 4000, and shortly after its
appearance, Mudie having demanded a second thousand, Blackwood
commenced striking off 2000 more, making 6000. While we were at Florence I had the news that these 6000 were all sold and that 500 more were being prepared). From all we can gather the votes are rather on the side of ""The Mill"" as a better book than ""Adam""."

The loss of the country has seemed very bitter to me, and my want ofhealth and strength has preventedme from working much - still worse, has made me despair of ever working well again. lam getting better now by the help of tonics, and I should be better still if l could gather more bravery, resignation and simplicity of striving. In the meantime my cup is full ofblessings: my home is bright and warm with love and tenderness, and in more material vulgar matters we are very fortunate. I have invested £2000 in East Indies Stock, and expect shortly to invest another £2000, so that with my other money, we have enough in any case to keep us from beggary. Last Tuesday, the 20th, we had a pleasant evening. Anthony Trollope dined with us, and made us like him very much by his straightforward, wholesome Wesen. 6 Afterwards Mr. Helps came in, and the talk was extremely agreeable. He told me the Queen had been speaking to him in great admiration of my books, especially the Mill on the Floss. It is interesting to know that Royalty can be touched by that sort of writing- and I was grateful to Mr. Helps for his wish to tell me of the sympathy given to me in that quarter. Today I have had a letter from M. d' Albert, saying that at last the French edition of Adam Bede is published. He pleases me very much by saying that he finds not a sentence that he can retrench in the first vol. of""The Mill"". 

I am engaged now in writing a story, the idea of which came to me after ourarrival in this house, and which has thrust itselfbetween me and the other book I was meditating. It is ""Silas Marner, the weaver ofRaveloe"". I am still only at about the 62nd page, for I have written slowly and interruptedly of late."

This year has been marked by many blessings, and above all by the comfort we have found in having Charles with us. Since we set out on our journey to Italy on March 25 the time has not been fruitful in work: distractions about our change of residence have run away with many days, and since I have been in London my state of health has been depressing to all effort.

discomfort. On the second, both G. and I were so poorly that we determined to run away to the country for a few days. Charles went with us on the Saturday afternoon to Dorking, leaving us on Sunday evening. On Monday the morning was brilliant, and we enjoyed a long walk. The country air had quite cured me already. In the afternoon we drove to Leatherhead and round home by several villages and a fine common. But the weather seemed already to threaten a change, and we resolved to return home the next day. In the morning we saw Deepdene, and returned home by railway to dinner, much strengthened and refreshed by our draughts offresh air. But yesterday and today I have been as ill as ever- incompetent from biliousness either to work or to enjoy. On Monday we went to a concert at St. J ames's Hall, and heard a grand quartett of Beethoven'sa, nd the Kreuzer Sonata, played by Vieuxtemps and Miss Goddard."

had an interview with G. He asked if I were open to ""a magnificent offer"". This

about Lorenzo de' Medici's death; 2°. about the possible retardation of Easter;
3°. about Corpus Christi day; 4°. about Savonarola's preaching in the Qμaresima

Diary 1861-1877,1862-01-31,108,133,N/A,"Jan. 31. The last day of this month! This evening I have been reading to G. some
entries in my note-book of past times in which I recorded my malaisean d
despair. But it is impossible to me to believe that I have ever been in so
unpromising and despairing a state as I now feel. - After writing these words,
I read to G. the Proem and opening scene of my novel and he expressed great
delight in them."

Sunday we walked to Nursie's in the afternoon. In the morning I had written
some dialogue and done a fair bit of work, but the rest of the day I was very
feeble, unable to do more than read newspapers. This morning was brilliant and
G. tempted me out to walk to Hampstead. We returned at 1/2 past 11 and I wrote
till lunch. This evening Charley has read to us the 12th No. of Orley Farm, which is interesting so far as it pursues the main path of the story- the fortunes of
Lady Mason."
Diary 1861-1877,1862-02-07,109,134,N/A,"7. A week of February already gone! I have been obliged to be very moderate in work, from feebleness of head and body; but I have re-written with additions
the first chapter of my book. I have done little reading in the last week. At present I am running along with Pulci, and have got interested in the paladins, but I find him less full of point and idiom than I expected after the first Canto or two. The other day Mr. G. Smith called and offered me 250 guineas for my story of the Idiot Brother, which George mentioned as lying by me. I am not quite certain yet whether I shall accept. Today we have been to the London Library and I have read J. Mill's article on ""The American Contest"". Mrs. Hooper called and brought me her little book."

Dorking to dine. I continued von Sybel in the evening."
Diary 1861-1877,1862-02-13,109,134,N/A,"13. There had been rain in the night, so we determined to come home by the 1/2
past eleven train; but this allowed us time for a little walk. We arrived at home at
1/2 past 1, and found Charlie's long-missing box, just come before us-a very
welcome sight. During our stay at Dorking I have finished the first 12 cantos of
Pulci."
Diary 1861-1877,1862-02-17,109,134,N/A,"Feb.17. Monday. I have written only the two first chapters of my novel besides
the Proem, and I have an oppressive sense of the far-stretching task before me,
health being feeble just now. On Saturday, Dr. Wyatt, Mr. F. Chapman, and Mr.
Boner from Munich were our visitors. I was much fatigued and consequently
not well on Sunday. We walked to Hampstead in a very cold wind. Today there
has been constant rain and fog, and I have not been out of doors."
Diary 1861-1877,1862-02-19,109,134,N/A,"19. This evening I read aloud to G. again, at his request the first 45 pages of my romance, Charlie also being present. The rain has been constant all day. Nevertheless we have been to the British Museum, and I have picked some details from Manni's life ofBartolommeo Scala-also from Borghini's Discorsi, about the simplicity of the Florentine table equipage.

I have lately read again with great delight Mrs. Browning's Casa Guidi
Windows. It contains amongst other admirable things a very noble expression of what I believe to be the true relation of the religious mind to the Past."
Diary 1861-1877,1862-02-26,109-110,134-135,N/A,"26. I have been very ailing all this last week and have worked under impeding
discouragement. I have a distrust in myself, in my work, in others' loving acceptance of it which robs my otherwise happy life of all joy. I ask myself, without being able to answer, whether I have ever before felt so chilled and
oppressed. On Saturday pleasant Mr. Williams from Birmingham joined our party. Yesterday, G. and I went to Egham by railway and walked on to Englefield Green to see a house which is to be letthere. We were pleased to have found out a beautiful country where we may, if we like, have lodgings at the Barley Mow Inn. I have written now about 60 pages of my romance. Will it ever be finished? - ever be worth anything?"
Diary 1861-1877,1862-02-27,110,135,N/A,"27. George Smith, the publisher, brought the proof of G.'s book ""Animal

abroad."

Smith wishes to have it commenced in May, and I cannot consent to begin
publication until I have seen nearly to the end of the work. In the evening we

Diary 1861-1877,1862-03-24,110,135,N/A,"24. Monday. After enjoying our week at Egham I returned to protracted headache and discomfort. G. too, has been, and is, very ailing. Miss Rennell paid us three visits after our return: another incident was a bit of unwonted dissipation - our going to the theatre to see an amusing piece in which Mr.
Frank Matthews was admirably disagreeable as an intimate friend. Last Saturday
we received as usual, and our party was joined by Mr. and Mrs. Noel. I have begun the Fourth Chapter of my novel, but have been working under a weight. During the interval I am noting down Mr. Simpson has been, from Edinburgh
and has brought us a pleasing account of Thornie."

Diary 1861-1877,1862-05-23,111,136,N/A,"23. Since I wrote last very important decisions have been made. I am to publish
my novel of Romola in the Cornhill Magazine for £7000 paid in twelve monthly
payments. There has been the regret of leaving Blackwood, who has written me a letter in the most perfect spirit of gentlemanliness and good feeling. - We have had one painful disappointment- more painful than almost anything that has occurred to us for years, namely, a letter from Mr. Trollope telling us that Charles is not thought well of as a worker at the Post Office. We have yet to learn how far he is himself conscious of any ground for complaint. 

Yesterday, Mr. Leighton the artist came to see me about the illustrations to my novel which he is going to undertake. Today Mr. T. Trollope came to see us,
on his arrival from Florence."

Diary 1861-1877,1862-06-10,111,136,N/A,"*June 10. Since the last record, we have been so far comforted about Charles,
that we find there has been no conscious slackness in duty on his part, and that
his character is very generally liked by his comrades and superiors. There is only
slowness of apprehension and of execution. I have not made quite so much way
in my new part as I had hoped to do in these first 10 days."

sufficiently determined in my resistance to sensational and external hindrances. The consequence is, that I am no further on in my MSS. and have lost the excellent start my early completion of the 3rd Part had given me."

progress. Yet I have been very well in body. G. has had a severe bilious attack, but
today is better. Thornton has started for Switzerland yesterday and today I have
been reading a book often referred to by Hallam: Meiners' Lives of Picus von

depression and incapacity. The constantly heavy, clouded and often wet
weather, tends to increase the depression. I am inwardly irritable and unvisited
by good thoughts. Reading the Purgatorio again, and the Compendium Revelation um of Savonarola ... After this record, I read aloud what I had written of Part IX to George, and he to my surprize entirely approved it."

Part which I think will be the dullest that has yet come. Yesterday a pleasant
message from Mr. Hannay about Romola.

We have had many blessings this year-opportunities which have enabled us to acquire an abundant independence, the satisfactory progress of our two eldest boys, various grounds of happiness in our work, and ever growing
happiness in each other. I hope with trembling that the coming year may be as comforting a retrospect: with trembling, because my work is not yet done. Besides the finishing of Romola, we have to think of Thornie's passing his final examination, and, in case of success, his going out to India: of Bertie's leaving

struggled on to the 33rd page. Last week Mr. Trollope and Mr. F. Chapman

Diary 1861-1877,1865-01-01,122,147,N/A,"1865
Jan. 1. The last year has been unmarked by any trouble except bad health. George has suffered much more malaise than in the two or three previous years, but now he is returned to his usual condition of delicacy without more than occasional ailments that incapacitate him from doing his morning's work. The bright spots in the year have been the publication of""Aristotle"" and our journey to Venice. With me the year has not been fruitful. I have written three acts of my drama and am now in a condition of body and mind to make me hope for better things in the coming year. The last quarter has made an epoch for me by the fact that for the first time in my serious authorship I have written verse, and George declares it to be triumphantly successful. We have had good news from Thornie in Natal; Bertie is with us for his holiday, delighting us by the improvement in his mind and health; and Charlie is happy in the prospect of his marriage in April. In each other, we are happier than ever: I am more grateful to my dear husband for his perfect love, which helps me in all good and checks me in all evil - more conscious that in him I have the greatest of blessings."

George has been prevailed on to be the Editor, has been finally decided on. I am
full of vain regrets that we did not persist in original refusal, for I dread the
worry and anxiety G. may have. About myself I am in deep depression feeling
powerless. I have written nothing but beginnings since I finished a little article
for the Pall Mall on the Logic of Servants. Dear George is all activity, yet is in very frail health. How I worship his good humour, his good sense, his affectionate care for everyone who has claims on him! That worship is my best life."

Fortnightly especially ofBagehot's articles, which last is reassuring after Mr.
Trollope's strong objections. Tyndal told G. that he dined with Lecky at Longman's and on going home read my article, which seemed to him to give a thoroughly just conception of the man - to ""hit him off exactly"". Thinks he will do nothing better. I am glad to have this testimony that I have not in this case done any injustice. 26. Maestro dined with us."

a monetary crisis in the colony, which has made his trading expedition of
doubtful result. He says it is of no use to send Bertie out without a little capital, and discourages the prospect of farming in Natal, so that we must now think of Bertie's being a trader.

The weather had been grey for two days but on this evening the sun shone out and we had a delightful stroll before dinner, getting our first view of the Priory. On Thursday, we spent the whole day in rambling through the woods to Barden Tower and back. Our comfortable little inn was the Red Lion, and we were tempted to lengthen our stay. But on Friday morning the sky was threatening, so we started for Newark, which we had visited in old days on our expedition to Gainsborough. At Newark, we found our old inn, the Ram, opposite the ruins of the Castle, and then we went for a stroll along the banks of the Trent, seeing some charming quiet pictures - Frith landscapes.

house and the cottages with the stone floors chalked in patterns. The landscape
was still rich with autumn leaves."

been usual with me in these last six months. But I am not yet engaged in any
work that makes a higher life for me- a life that is young and grows, though
in my other life I am getting old and decaying. It is a day for resolves, and
determination. I am meditating the subject of Timoleon."
Diary 1861-1877,1868-12-30,133-134,158-159,N/A,"Dec 30. I make today the last record that I shall enter of the old year 1868. It has
been as rich in blessings as any preceding year of our double life, and I enjoy a
more and more even cheerfulness, and continually encreasing power of
dwelling on the good that is given to me, and dismissing the thought of small
evils. The chief event of the year to us has been the publication, and friendly reception by the public, of""The Spanish Gypsy"". The greatest happiness (after
our growing love) which has sprung and flowed onward during the latter part
of the year, is George's interest in his psychological inquiries. I have perhaps
gained a little higher ground and firmer footing in some studies, not withstanding the yearly loss of retentive power. We have made some new friendships, that cheer us with the sense of new admiration of actual living
beings whom we know in the flesh, and who are kindly disposed towards us.
And we have had no real trouble. I wish we were not in a minority of our fellowmen! - I desire no added blessing for the coming year but these: that I may do some good, lasting work, and make both my outward and inward habits less imperfect, that is, more directly tending to the best uses of life."

Jan 1. A bright frosty morning! And we are both well. The servants are going to have their little treat, and we are going to see Mr. and Mrs. Burne Jones and carry
a book for their little boy. I have set myself many tasks for the year- I wonder
how many will be accomplished? A Novel called Middlemarch, a long poem on Timoleon, and several minor poems."
Diary 1861-1877,1869-01-23,134,159,N/A,"Jan. 23. Since I wrote last I have finished a little poem on Old Agatha. But the last week or two I have been so disturbed in health that no work prospers. I have made a little way in constructing my new Tale, have been reading a little on philology, have finished the 24th Book of the Iliad, the first book of the Faery Queene, Clough's poems, and a little about Etruscan things in Mrs. Grey and Dennis. Aloud to G. I have been reading some Italian, BenJ onson's Alchemist and Volpone, and Bright's Speeches, which I am still reading- besides the first
four Cantos ofDonJuan. But the last two or three days I have seemed to live under a leaden pressure - all movement mental or bodily is grievous to me.

In the evening read aloud Bright's 4th speech on India, and a story in Italian. In the Spectator some interesting facts about loss of memory, and ""double life"". In the Revue des Cours a lecture by Sir W. Thomson of Edinburgh on the retardation of the earth's motion round its axis."

I have read Mommsen's Rome."
Diary 1861-1877,1869-02-06,134-135,159-160,N/A,"Feb. 6. The last few days I have been looking through Matthew Arnold's poems,
and find his earlier ones very superior to the later. Yesterday I wrote the song of
Minuccio in Lisa. Today at verse 404, ""who meetly told that lovetale meet to
know"". We went to the third concert, which was rather spoiled by Piatti's absence and the inferiority of his substitute Pezzi. Madame Schumann played finely in Mendelssohn's Quintett, and a Trio of Beethoven's. As a solo she played the Sonata in D minor. In the evening I read aloud a short speech of Bright's on Ireland, delivered 20 years ago, in which he insists that nothing will be a remedy for the woes of that country unless the Church Establishment be annulled: after the lapse of 20 years the measure is going to be adopted. Then I read aloud a bit of the ""Promessi Sposi"", and afterwards the Spectator, in which there is a
deservedly high appreciation of Lowell's Poems."

make me an honorary member of their society- I declined. Mrs. Senior came to lunch with us, and then we walked. G. finished reading ""Séraphime"" aloud to me."

Diary 1861-1877,1869-05-05,135,160,N/A,"May 5. We reached our home after our nine weeks' absence. In that time we
have been through France to Marseilles; along the Corniche to Spezia; then
to Pisa, Florence, Naples, Rome, Assisi, Perugia, Florence again, Ravenna,
Bologna, Verona; across the Brenner Pass, to Munich; then to Paris via
Strasburg. In such a journey, there was necessarily much interest both in
renewing old memories and recording new; but I never had such continuous
bad health in travelling as I have had during these nine weeks.

On our arrival at home I found a delightful letter from Mrs. H. B. Stowe, whom I have never seen, addressing me as her ""dear friend""."

Idyll ofTheocritus, and have written three more Sonnets. My head uneasy. We
went in the afternoon to the Old Water Colours, finding that the Exhibition was
to close at the end of the week. BurneJones's Circe and St. George affected me by
their colour, more than any of the other pictures: they are poems. In the evening
read Nisard on Rabelais and Calvin and Marot."

bodily disturbance. I have finished eleven Sonnets on ""Brother and Sister"", read
Littré, Nisard; part of 22nd Idyll of Theocritus, Sainte Beuve aloud to G. two
evenings. On Thursday: the evening was occupied with Gertrude and Charles, Monday evening with looking through Dickson's Fallacies of the Faculty. On Tuesday afternoon we went to the British Museum to see a new bronze, and I was enchanted with some fragments of glass in the Slade Collection, with dyes of sunset in them. Yesterday, sitting in Thornie's room I read through all
Shakspeare's sonnets. Poor Thornie has had a miserably unsatisfactory week, making no progress. After lunch came Miss N. Smith and Miss Blythe, Mr. Burton, Mr. and

Diary 1861-1877,1869-09-24,138,163,N/A,"24. Returned home this morning because of the unpromising weather. It is
worth while to record my great depression of spirits, that I may remember one
more resurrection from the pit of melancholy. And yet what love is given to me!
-what abundance of good I possess. All my circumstances are blessed; and the defect is only in my own organism. Courage and effort!"
Diary 1861-1877,1869-10-05,138,163,N/A,"Oct. 5. Ever since the 28th I have been good for little, ailing in body and
disabled in mind. On Sunday an interesting Russian pair came to see us, M. and
Mde Kovilevsky: she, a pretty creature with charming modest voice and speech,
who is studying Mathematics (by allowance through the aid of Kirchhoff) at
Heidelberg; he amiable and intelligent, studying the concrete sciences,
apparently- especially geology; and about to go to Vienna for six months for
this purpose, leaving his wife at Heidelberg! - I have begun a long-meditated poem:
""The Legend of Jubal"", but have not written more than 20 or 30 verses."
Diary 1861-1877,1869-10-13,138-139,163-164,N/A,"13. Yesterday Mr. Clark of Cambridge came to see us, and told of his intention to
give up his oratorship and renounce his connexion with the Church. I have read
rapidly through Max Muller's History of Sanskrit Literature and am now reading Lecky's History of Morals. I have also finished H. Spencer's last number of his Psychology. My head has been sadly feeble and my whole body ailing of late. I have written about 100 verses of my poem. Poor Thornie seems to us in a state of growing weakness."
Diary 1861-1877,1869-10-19,139,164,N/A,"Oct. 19. 1869. This evening, at half past six o'clock our dear Thornie died. He went quite peacefully. For three days he was not more than fitfully and imperfectly conscious of the things around him. 

He went to Natal on the 17th of October, 1863, and came back to us ill, on the 8th of May, 1869. Through the six months of his illness, his frank impulsive mind disclosed no trace of evil feeling. He was a sweet-natured boy- still a boy
though he had lived for 25 years and a hal£ On the 9th of August he had an attack of paraplegia, and although he partially recovered, from it, it made a marked change in him. After that, he lost a great deal ofhis vivacity. But he suffered less pain. This death seems to me the beginning of our own."
Diary 1861-1877,1870-05-20,139,164,N/A,"May 20th. 1870. I am fond of my little old book in which I have recorded so many changes, and shall take to writing in it again. It will perhaps last me all
through the life that is left to me. Since I wrote in it last, the day after Thornie's
death, the chief epochs have been our stay at Limpsfield, in Surrey, till near the
beginning of December (I think we returned on the 21st November); my writing
of Jubal, which I finished on the 13th of January; the publication of the poem in
Macmillan's Magazine (May No.); and our journey to Berlin and Vienna from
which we returned on the 6th of this month, after an absence of eight weeks.
This is a fortnight ago, and little has been done by me in this interim. My health
is in an uncomfortable state, and I seem to be all the weaker for the continual
depression produced by cold and sore-throat which stretched itself all through
our long journey. My teeth have teazed me a great deal since Xmas, and these
small bodily grievances make life less desirable to me, though every one of my
best blessings - my one perfect love, and the sympathy shown towards me for the sake of my work, and the personal regard of a few friends - have become
much intensified in these latter days. I am not hopeful about future work: I am
languid, and my novel languishes too. But tomorrow may be better than today."
Diary 1861-1877,1870-05-25,139-140,164-165,N/A,"Wednesday, May 25. We started for Oxford at 1/2 past 9, and arrived at Lincoln
College, where we were to stay with the Rector and his wife about 12. After
luncheon, G. and I walked alone through the town, which on this first view was
rather disappointing to me. Presently we turned through Christ Church into the Meadows and walked along by the river. This was beautiful, to my heart's
content. The buttercups and hawthorns were in their glory, the chestnuts still
in sufficiently untarnished bloom; and the grand elms made a border towards
the town. After tea, we went with Mrs. Pattison and the Rector to the croquet
ground near the Museum. On our way we saw Sir Benjamin Brodie; and on the ground Professor Rawlinson, the ""narrow-headed man"", Mrs. Thursfield, and her son who is a fellow (I think of Corpus), Miss Arnold, daughter of Mr. Tom Arnold, and Prof. Phillips, the Geologist. At supper we had Mr. Bywater and Miss Arnold, and in chat with them, the evening was passed."
Diary 1861-1877,1870-05-26,140,165,N/A,"26. G. and I went to the Museum, and had an interesting morning with Dr.
Rolleston who dissected a brain for me. After lunch, we went again to the
Museum, and spent the afternoon with Sir Benjamin Brodie, seeing various
objects in his laboratories, amongst others the method by which weighing has
been superseded in delicate matters by measuring in a graduated glass tube.
After, Mrs. Pattison took me a drive in her little pony carriage round by their
country refuge -The Firs, Haddington, and by Li ttlemore, where I saw J. H.
Newman's little conventual dwellings. Returning we had a fine view of the Oxford towers. To supper came Sir Benjamin and Lady Brodie."
Diary 1861-1877,1870-05-27,140,165,N/A,"27. In the morning we walked to see the two Martyrs' Memorial, and then took
a cab to Sir Benjamin Brodie' s pretty place near the river and bridge. Close by their grounds is the original ford whence the place took its name. The Miss Gaskells were staying with them, and after chatting some time, we two walked with Sir Benjamin to New College, where we saw the gardens surrounded by the old City wall; the chapel where William of Wykeham's crozier is kept, and the cloisters, which are fine but gloomy, and less beautiful than those of Magdalen which we saw in our walk on Thursday, before going to the Museum. After lunch we went to the Bodleian, and then to the Sheldonian Theatre, where there was a meeting apropos of Palestine Exploration. Captain Warren, conductor of the Exploration at Jerusalem read a paper, and then Mr. Deutsch gave an account of the interpretation, as hitherto arrived at, of the Moabite Stone. I saw ""squeezes"" of this stone for the first time, with photographs taken from the squeezes. After tea we went- Mrs. Thursfield kindly took us - to see a boat-race.
We saw it from the Oriel barge, under the escort of Mr. Crichton, fellow of
Merton, who on our return took us through the lovely gardens of his college. At
supper were Mr. Jowett, Prof. Henry Smith, Miss E. Smith his sister, Mr. Fowler, author of""Deductive Logic"", and Mr. Pater, writer of articles on Leonardo da Vinci, Morris etc."
Diary 1861-1877,1870-05-28,140,165,N/A,"28. After a walk to St.John's College, we started by the train for London and I
arrived at home about 2 o'clock, delighted to be under our own roof again."
Diary 1861-1877,1870-05-29,140,165,N/A,"29. Mr. Spencer, Mrs. Burne Jones and Mr. Crompton came. I read aloud No. 3
of ""Edwin Drood""."
Diary 1861-1877,1870-05-30,140,165,N/A,"30. We went to see the autotypes of Michael Angelo's frescoes at 36, Rathbone Place. I began Grove on the Correlation of the Physical Forces, needing to read it again with new interests after the lapse of years."
Diary 1861-1877,1870-05-31,140,165,N/A,"31. We walked to Hampstead to see mother in her new lodgings. Mr. and Mrs.
Lytton called, and Mr. and Mrs. Call. In the evening, G. being very weary, I read
him some of Rossetti's poems. Continuing Grove.
End of May"
Diary 1861-1877,1870-08-04,141,166,N/A,"August 4. Two months have been spent since the last record! Their result is not
rich, for we have been sent wandering again by G's want of health. On the 15th of
June, we went to Cromer; on the 30th, to Harrogate, and on the 18th o fJuly to Whitby, where Mrs. Burne Jones also arrived on the same day. On Monday August 1 we came home again, for a week only, having arranged to go to Limpsfield next Monday. To-day, under much depression, I begin a little dramatic poem the subject of which engaged my interest at Harrogate."
Diary 1861-1877,1870-10-27,141,166,N/A,"Oct. 27. On Monday the 8th of August we went to our favourite Surrey retreat,
Limpsfield and enjoyed three weeks there, reading and walking together. The
weather was perfect, and the place seemed more lovely to us than before. Aloud I read the concluding part of Walter Scott's Life which we had begun at Harrogate, two volumes of Froude's History of England, and Comte's correspondence with Valat. We returned on Monday the 29th. Before our return we had had a letter from Bertie telling us, to our joy, that he was engaged to a
""well-educated young lady, Eliza Stevenson Harrison"", and we agreed to write to the young lady's father on the subject to see if any provision could be made
for their early marriage.

During our stay at Limpsfield I wrote the greater part of""Armgart"", and finished it at intervals during September. Since then I have been continually suffering from headache and depression, with almost total despair of future work. I look into this little book now to assure myself that this is not unprecedented."
Diary 1861-1877,1870-12-02,141,166,N/A,"Dec. 2. I am experimenting in a story, which I began without any very serious
intention of carrying it out lengthily. It is a subject which has been recorded
among my possible themes ever since I began to write fiction, but will probably
take new shapes in the development. I am today at p. 44.

I am reading Wolfs Prolegomena to Homer. In the evening aloud, Wilhelm
Meister again!"
Diary 1861-1877,1870-12-10,141,166,N/A,"Dec. 10. George's Mother died this morning, quite peacefully as she sat in her chair."

Diary 1861-1877,1870-12-31,141,166,N/A,"Dec. 31. On Wednesday the 21st we went to Ryde to see Madame Bodichon at
Swanmore Parsonage, a house which she had taken for two months. We had a
pleasant and healthy visit, walking much in the frosty air. On Christmas day I
went with her to the Ritualist Church which is attached to the Parsonage and heard some excellent intoning by the delicate-faced tenor-voiced clergyman Mr. Hooker Wicks. On Wednesday last, the 28th, Barbara came up to town with us. We found the cold here more severe than at Ryde, and the papers tell of still harder weather about Paris where our fellow-men are suffering and inflicting
horrors. Am I doing anything that will add the weight of a sand grain against the persistence of such evil? 

Here is the last day of 1870. I have written only 100 pages -good printedpages - of a story which I began about the opening ofNovember, and at present
mean to call ""Miss Brooke"". Poetry halts just now.

In my private lot I am unspeakably happy, loving and beloved. But I am
doing little for others."
Diary 1861-1877,1871-03-19,142,167,N/A,"Sunday, March 19. 1871. It is grievous to me how little, from one cause or other,
chiefly languor and occasionally positive ailments, I manage to get done. I have written about 236 pages (print) of my Novel, which I want to get off my hands by next November. My present fear is that I have too much matter, too many
""momente""."
Diary 1861-1877,1871-12-01,142,167,N/A,"Dec 1. This day the first Part of ""Middlemarch"" was published. I ought by this
time to have finished the fourth Part, but an illness which began soon after our
return from Haslemere has robbed me of two months."
Diary 1861-1877,1871-12-20,142,167,N/A,"20. My health has become very troublesome during the last three weeks, and I
can get on but tardily. Even now, I am only at p. 227 of my fourth Part. But I have
been also retarded by construction which, once done, serves as good wheels to progress."
Diary 1861-1877,1872-01-30,142,167,N/A,"1872. It is now the last day but one of January. I have finished the Fourth Part.
i.e. the znd volume of Middlemarch. The First Part published on Dec. 1. has
been excellently well received, and the second Part will be published the day
after tomorrow.

 About Xmas a volume of extracts from my works was published under the
title ""Wise, Witty and Tender Sayings in Prose and Verse"". It was proposed and
executed by Alexander Main, a young man of 30, who began a correspondence
with me by asking me how to pronounce Romola, in the summer when we were
at Shotter Mill. Blackwood proposed that we should share the profits, but we
refused."
Diary 1861-1877,1872-05-08,142,167,N/A,"May 8. I have been reposing for more than a week in the hope of getting stronger- my life having been lately a swamp of illness with only here and there a bit of firm walking. In consequence of this incesssant interruption almost every week having been half nullified for me so far as my work has been
concerned, I have only finished the Fifth Book, and have still three Books to
write- equal to a large volume and a ha1£

The reception of the book hitherto has been quite beyond what I could have
believed beforehand, people exalting it above everything else I have written.
Kohn is publishing an English Edition in Germany; Duncker is to publish a
translation; and Harpers pay me £1200 for reprinting it in America."
Diary 1861-1877,1873-01-01,142,167,N/A,"Jan. 1. 1873. At the beginning of December the eighth and last book of Middlemarch was published, the three final numbers having been published monthly. No former book of mine has been received with more enthusiasm - not even Adam Bede, and I have received many deeply affecting assurances of its influence for good on individual minds. Hardly anything could have happened to me which I could regard as a greater blessing than this growth of my spiritual existence when my bodily existence is decaying. The merely egoistic
satisfactions of fame are easily nullified by toothache, and that has made my
chief consciousness for the last week. This morning, when I was in pain and
taking a melancholy breakfast in bed, some sweet natured creature sent a
beautiful bouquet to the door for me, bound round with the written wish that
""every year may be happier and happier, and that God's blessing may ever abide
with the immortal author of Silas Marner"". Happily my dear husband is well
and able to enjoy these things for me. That he rejoices in them is my most
distinct personal pleasure in such tributes."
Diary 1861-1877,1873-05-19,143,168,N/A,"Monday May 19. We paid a visit to Cambridge at the invitation of Mr. Frederick
Myers, and I enjoyed greatly talking with him and some others of the ""Trinity
Men"". In the evenings we went to see the Boat race and then returned to supper
and talk- the first evening with Mr. Henry Sidgwick, Mr. Jebb, Mr. Edmund Gurney; the second, with young Balfour, young Lyttleton, Mr.Jackson, and Edmund Gurney again. Mrs. and Miss Huth were also our companions during the visit. On the Tuesday morning we breakfasted at Mr. Sidgwick's with Mr. Jebb, Mr. G.W. Clark, Mr. Myers, and Mrs. and Miss Huth."
Diary 1861-1877,1873-05-22,143,168,N/A,"22. We went to the French play at the Princess's and saw Plessy and Desclee in
""Les idées de Mde. Aubray"". I am just finishing again Aristotle's Poetics which
I first read in 1856."
Diary 1861-1877,1873-11-07,143-144,168-169,N/A,"Nov. 7. In the beginning of June we paid a visit to Mr.Jowett at Oxford, meeting there Mr. and Mrs. Charles Roundell then newly married. We stayed from
Saturday till Monday, and I was introduced to many persons of interest- Prof.
Green, Max Muller, Thompson, the Master of Trinity College, Cambridge and Mr. Wordsworth, the grandson of the poet, who had spent much time in India
and a host of others ""too tedious to mention"". 

Soon afterwards we went abroad-stayed a few days at Fontainebleau, then went by easy stages to Plombieres where we stayed three weeks - then to Luxeuil for a week- then, hurried on by alarm about G's deafness, to Frankfort, and thence to Homburg. Home again through France. On our way to Plombieres we had seen Troyes and Nancy; on our way back we saw Mainz,
Metz, Verdun, Rheims and Amiens.

We remained only a week at the Priory and then went down to Blackbrook, near Bickley, which we had taken prospectively before going abroad, intending to hold it for a year on trial. But we found it advisable to give it up at the end of the two months from Sep. 4 to Oct. 31, the house being too ill garrisoned with furniture and too ill fortified against the cold. But we left it with regret, having learned to love the neighbourhood and the secluded grounds where we were shut in from all ugliness and intrusion.

Now we are in our London home again expecting to keep stationary through the winter. The first volume of my dear husband's work ""Problems of Life and
Mind"" - the Studies for which have made a chief epoch in his life, having
included the becoming acquainted with Mathematics in his 6th decade- is about to be published. And we are entirely happy, save that his health has flagged sadly during the last seven or eight months. 

I am in tolerable bodily comfort, but not good for much in mind, and slow
to concentrate myself."
Diary 1861-1877,1874-01-01,144,169,N/A,"1874. January 1. The happy old year in which we have had constant enjoyment
oflife notwithstanding much bodily malaise, is gone from us for ever. More than in any former year of my life, love has been poured forth to me from distant hearts, and in our own home we have had that finish to domestic comfort which only faithful, kind servants can give. Our children are prosperous and happy, Charles evidently growing in mental efficiency; we have abundant wealth for more than our actual needs; and our unspeakable joy in each other has no other
alloy than the sense that it must one day end in parting. My dear husband has a
store of present and prospective good in the long work which is likely to stretch
through the remaining years ofhis intellectual activity, and there have not been wanting signs that what he has already published is being appreciated rightly by capable persons. He is thinner than ever and is only just getting the better of
much dyspeptic discomfort that has beset him since the beginning of November, but still he shows wonderful elasticity and nervous energy.

 have been for a month rendered almost helpless for intellectual work by
constant headache and nausea, but am getting a little more freedom. Nothing is
wanting to my blessings but the uninterrupted power of work. For as to all my
unchangeable imperfections I have resigned myself."
Diary 1861-1877,1874-01-17,144,169,N/A,"Jan. 17. 187 4. I received this morning from Blackwood the accounts of Middlemarch and of the Spanish Gypsy for 1873. Of the guinea edition of Middlemarch published in the spring 2,434 copies have been sold. Of the Spanish Gypsy 292 copies have been sold during 1873,a nd the remaining copies are only 197. Thus out of 4,470 which have been printed, 4,273 have been distributed."

George continues to have tolerable health and is far on in the preparation ofhis second volume. On the 1st ofJune we go into the country, to The Cottage, Earlswood Common, for 4 months, and I hope there to get deep shafts sunk in my prose book. My health has been a wretched drag on me during this last half year. I have lately written, A Symposium."
Diary 1861-1877,1875-01-13,144-145,169-170,N/A,"Jan. 13. 1875. Here is a great gap since I last made a record!B ut the time has been filled full ofhappiness. Yesterday I received from Blackwood the last year's
account of Middlemarch, Jubal and the Spanish Gypsy, amounting to £860. Of Jubal a second edition was published in August and the 4th edition of the Spanish Gypsy is all sold. This morning I received a copy of the 5th edition. The amount of copies sold of Middlemarch up to Dec. 31 is between 19 and 20,000. 

Yesterday I also received the good news that the engagement between Emily
Cross and Mr. Otter is settled. 

The last year has been crowded with proofs of affection for me and of value
for what work I have been able to do. This makes the best motive or encouragement to do more; but as usual I am suffering much from doubt as to
the worth of what I am doing and fear lest I may not be able to complete it so as
to make it a contribution to literature and not a mere addition to the heap of
books. I am now just beginning the part about Deronda, at p. 234."
Diary 1861-1877,1875-06-[ND],145,170,N/A,"June 15 or 17 we went to a house we had taken at Rickmansworth. Here in the
end of July we received the news that our dear Bertie had died on June 29th. Our stay at Rickmansworth, though otherwise peaceful was not marked by any great
improvement in health from the change to country instead of town - rather the
contrary. We left on Sep. 23 and then set off on a journey into Wales which was
altogether unfortunate on account of the incessant rain. After our return I grew
better and wrote with some success - G. worse, and consequently he consulted
Dr. Reynolds, whose prescriptions seem to have answered so that he has
recovered his usual power of enjoying work.

For the last three weeks, however I have been suffering from a cold and its
effects so as to be unable to make any progress. Meanwhile , the 2 first volumes of Daniel Deronda are in print and the first Book is to be published on Feb. 1. - I have thought very poorly ofit myself throughout , but George and the
Blackwoods are full of satisfaction in it.

Each part as I see it before me im werden seems less likely to be anything else
than a failure, but I see on looking back this morning- Christmas Day- that I
really was in worse health and suffered equal depression about Romola - and so far as I have recorded, the same thing seems to be true of Middlemarch.

I have finished the Vth Book, but am not far on in the VIth as I hoped to have been, the oppression under which I have been labouring having positively suspended my power of writing anything that I could feel satisfaction in."

Diary 1861-1877,1876-04-12,145,170,N/A,"Ap. 12. On February 1 began the publication of Deronda, and the interest of the
public, strong from the first, appears to have increased with Book III. The day
before yesterday I sent off Book VII. The success of the work at present is greater than that of Middlemarch up to the corresponding point of
publication. What will be the feeling of the public as the story advances I am entirely doubtful. The Jewish element seems to me likely to satisfy nobody. I am in rather better health, having perhaps profited by some eight days' change at Weybridge."

Diary 1861-1877,1876-12-01,146,171,N/A,"Dec. 1. Since we came home at the beginning of September I have been made aware of much repugnance or else indifference towards the Jewish part of Deronda, and of some hostile as well as adverse reviewing. On the other hand there have been the strongest expressions of interest - some persons adhering to the opinion, started during the early numbers, that the book is my best - delightful letters have here and there been sent to me, and the sale both in America and in England has been an unmistakeable guarantee that the public has been touched. Words of gratitude have come from Jews and Jewesses, and  there are certain signs that I may have contributed my mite to a good result. The sale hitherto has exceeded that of Middlemarch as to the £2/2s four-volumed ),J, t
form, but we do not expect an equal success for the guinea edition which has 
lately been issued."

Diary 1861-1877,1876-12-15,146-147,171-172,N/A,"15. At the beginning of this week I had deep satisfaction fro1n reading in the
Times the report of a lecture on Daniel Deronda delivered by Dr. Hermann
Adler to the Jewish Working Men, a lecture showing much insight and
in1plying an expectation of serious benefit. Since then, I have had a delightful
letter from the Jewish Theological Seminary at Breslau written by an American
Jew named Isaacs, who excuses himself for expressing his feeling of gratitude
on reading Deronda, and assures me of his belief that it has even already had an
elevating effect on the minds of some among his people - predicting that the
effect will spread.

I have also had a request from Signor Bartolommeo Aquarone, of Siena, for
leave to translate Romola, and declaring that, as one who has given special study
to the History of San Marco and has written a life ofFraJeronimo Savonarola, he cares especially that 'Romola' should be known to his countrymen for their
good. He afterwards found that a previously existing translation was a
hindrance, though out of print. Magnificat anima mea!

And last night I had a letter from Dr. Benisch, Editor of the Jewish Chronicle,
announcing a copy of the paper containing an article written by himself on
reading 'Deronda' ( there have long ago been two articles in the same journal
reviewing the book) and using strong words as to the effect the book is
producing. I record these signs, that I may look back on them if they come
to be confirmed.

in the East, and next about the calamities consequent on the continued rains.

a week by an attack of influenza ending in bilious sickness and headache, from
which I have not been free till the last twenty-four hours. Since I wrote last, G's

the effect wrought by 'Deronda', especially among Jews."

November 10. We went to the Heights, Witley at the beginning of June, after a
delightful visit to Cambridge, and returned to this old home on the 29th. We are at last in love with our Surrey house and mean to keep it. The air and abundant exercise have quite renovated my health, and I am in more bodily comfort than I have known for several years. But my dear husband's condition is less satisfactory, his headaches still tormenting him.

Since the year began several little epochs have marked themselves. Blackwood offered me £4,000 for another ten years' copyright of my works, the previous agreement for ten years having expired. I declined, choosing to have a royalty. G's third volume has been well received and has sold satisfactorily for a book so little in the popular taste. A pleasant correspondence has been opened with Professor Kauffmann, now principal of the Jewish Theological Seminary at Pesth, and his ""Attempt at an appreciation of Daniel Deronda"" has been translated into English by young Ferrier, son
of Professor Ferrier.

A new Cabinet Edition of my Works, including 'Romola', has been decided
on and is being prepared, and there have been multiplied signs that the spiritual effect of 'Deronda' is growing. The 7/6 edition has lately appeared. In America the book is placed above all my previous writings. 

Our third Iittle Hampstead granddaughter has been born and was christened Saturday the 3rd- Eleanor.

Yesterday, Mr. Macmillan came to ask me ifl would undertake to write the
volume on Shakspearine a series to be issued under the title, ""Men of Letters"". I have declined."

Rectorship of St. Andrews. Blackwood writes me that in less than a month they
have sold off all but 400 of the 5250 printed. And in October were sold 495 of the
3/6 Adam Bede. Magnificat anima meal.

Our friend Dr. Allbutt came to see us last week, after we had missed each
other for 3 or 4 years."
Diary 1861-1877,1877-12-31,148,173,N/A,"Dec. 31. Today I say a final farewell to this little book which is the only record
I have made of my personal life for sixteen years and more. I have often been
helped by looking back in it to compare former with actual states of despondency from bad health or other apparent causes. In this way a past
despondency has turned to present hopefulness. But of course as the years
advance there is a new rational ground for the expectation that my life may
become less fruitful. The difficulty is, to decide how far resolution should set
in the direction of activity rather than in the acceptance of a more negative state.
Many conceptions of works to be carried out present themselves, but confidence
in my own fitness to complete them worthily is all the more wanting because it
is reasonable to argue that I must have already done my best. In fact, my mind is
embarrassed by the number and wide variety of subjects that attract me, and the
enlarging vista that each brings with it.

I shall record no more in this book, because I am going to keep a more business-like diary. Here ends 1877."

That brighten into green and gold.

Calm and still light on yon great plain
      That sweeps with all its autumn bowers,
      And crowded farms and lessening towers,
To mingle with the bounding main:

Calm and deep peace in this wide air,
      These leaves that redden to the fall;
      And in my heart, if calm at all,
If any calm, a calm despair:

Calm on the seas, and silver sleep,
     And waves that sway themselves in rest,
     And dead calm in that noble breast
Which heaves but with the heaving deep. *"

Diary 1879,1879-12-17,188,213,WEDNESDAY 17,"Cold in the earth - and the deep snow piled above thee
Far, far removed, cold in the dreary grave!
Have I forgot, my only love, to love thee,
Severed at last by Time's all-severing wave?

Now when alone, do my thoughts no longer hover
Over the mountains, on that northern shore,
Resting their wings where heath and fern leaves cover
Thy noble heart for ever, ever more?

Cold in the earth- and fifteen wild Decembers,
From those brown hills have melted into Spring
Faithful indeed is the spirit that remembers
After such years of change and suffering!

Sweet love of youth, forgive, ifI forget thee
While the world's tide is bearing me along;
Other desires and other hopes beset me,
Hopes which obscure but cannot do thee wrong!

No later light has lightened up my heaven
No second morn has ever shone for me;
All my life's bliss from thy dear life was given
All my life's bliss is in the grave with thee.

But when the days of golden dreams had perished
And even Despair was powerless to destroy;
Then did I learn how existence could be cherished,
Strengthened and fed without the aid of joy.

Then did I check the tears of useless passion -
Weaned my young soul from yearning after thine;
Sternly denied its burning wish to hasten
Down to that tomb already more than mine.

And even yet I dare not let it languish
Dare not indulge in memory's rapturous pain. 
Once drinking deep of that divinest anguish 
How could I seek the empty world again?

Germany 1858,1858-04-11,310-311,335-336,1858-04-11,"Sunday 11. We went to the Jesuitenkirche for the first time this morning. The effect of the interior is very fine -  a roof of great span unsupported by arches and covered with fresco. We lost some of the music by being a little too late, but heard enough to repay us for going-a quire of fresh boys' voices blending with the rolling organ.
	There were two confessionals placed opposite each other about half way up the church, and while the sermon was going forward, a priest sitting in each of them, received the confession of one penitent after another-all men or women clad in the dress of the working people. We waited through the sermon, delivered in a monotonous loud tone by rather a hard-looking priest. He stood in the passage between the two rows of benches, and held a book in his hand, to which he referred frequently as if reading passages which he then went on to expound or comment on. But the resonance was too great for us to hear much that he said. We staid to the end, hoping to hear more music, but there was none. The congregation departed in silence.
	From the church we went to the Pinacothek, straight into the glorious Rubens-Saal. Delighted afresh in the picture of Samson and Delilah, both for the painting and character of the figures. Delilah, a magnificent blond, seated in a chair, with a transparent white shift lightly covering her body and a rich red piece of drapery round her legs, leans forward with one hand resting on her thigh, the other, holding the cunning shears, resting on the chair-a posture which shows to perfection the full round living arms. She turns her head aside to look with sly triumph at Samson, a tawny giant, his legs caught in the red drapery, shorn of his long locks, furious with the consciousness that the Philistines are upon him, and that this time he cannot shake them off. Above the group of malicious faces and grappling arms, a hand holds a flaming torch. Behind Delilah, and grasping her arm leans forward an old woman with hard features full of exultation.
	This picture, comparatively small in size, hangs beside the LastJudgment, and in the corresponding space on the other side of the same picture hangs the sublime Crucifixion - Jesus alone hanging dead on the cross, darkness over the whole earth. One can desire nothing in this picture -  the grand, sweet calm of the dead face, calm and satisfied amidst all the traces of anguish, the real, livid flesh, the thorough mastery with which the whole form is rendered, and the isolation of the supreme sufferer, make a picture that haunts one like a remembrance of a friend's death-bed.
"
Germany 1858,1858-04-12,311,336,1858-04-12,"Monday 12. After reading Anna Mary Howitt's book on Munich, and Overbeck on Greek art, we turned out into the delicious sunshine to walk in the Theresien Wiese, and have our first look at the colossal Bavaria, the greatest work of Schwanthaler. Delightful it was to get away from the houses into this breezy meadow, where we heard the larks singing above us. The sun was still too high in the west for us to look with comfort at the statue except right in front of it, when it eclipsed the sun. And this front view is the only satisfactory one. The outline made by the head and arm on a side view is almost painfully ugly. But in front, looking up to the beautiful calm face, the impression it produces is sublime. I have never seen anything even in ancient sculpture of a more awful beauty than this dark colossal head looking out from a background of pure pale blue sky. We mounted the platform to have a view of her back, and then, walking forward, looked to our right hand and saw-the snow-covered Alps! Sight more to me than all the art in Munich, though I love the Art nevertheless. The great wide-stretching earth and the all-embracing sky-the birth-right of us all-are what I care most to look at, after all. And I feel intensely the new beauty of the sky here. The blue is so exquisitely clear, and the wide streets give one such a broad canopy of sky. I felt more inspirited by our walk to the Theresien-Platz than by any pleasure we have had in Munich. We came back quickly to set out again for the Residenz-Theater, where we were going to see Lady Tartüffe in a German dress. A very pretty little theatre it is, ornamented with sculptured wood, all dead white and gold with crimson draperies. The play was very respectably performed, and there was a delicious bit of real comedy in the make up, physiognomy and by-play of the president of the Benevolent Society, by Herr Keller. The Germans are excellent in these quiet bits of humour."
Germany 1858,1858-04-13,312,337,1858-04-13,"Tuesday 13. We took a droschky to the Maria-HilfKirche in the Au, and enjoyed this easy way of seeing the streets. The exterior of the church is conspicuous in its beauty, springing up with ease and grace from among the level blocks of houses around it. It is built of brick, the spire, with its sprouting leaf-like ornaments, of stone. The interior is fine and impressive, though the fluted columns are so thick and heavy for so small an area. But the loftiness of their shafts, and the rich colouring of the glass - all the windows are of coloured glass, representing the history of the Virgin and the Saviour - incline one to admire rather than to criticise.
	We walked back, taking the Begräbniss Platz on our way, that we might see Mrs. Costello's tomb, which George had undertaken to seek out. Dudley and Louisa Costello pay a certain sum yearly to have the grave kept in order, and were anxious to have the testimony of an eye-witness that the sum is not paid in vain. It looks very neat, with a border of violets, now coming into flower. We plucked two, to send to Louisa - then walked on through the cemetery. It affected me strangely, but not unpleasantly-this home of the multitudinous dead (the ancients called dying, going ad plures) and I should often walk there if l were alone.
	We had meant to go to the Theresien Wiese again, and see the Bavaria by the light of the sinking sun; but we were too early for this, so we went instead to the Hof-garten, where the chesnut-buds are beginning to burst, and drank a glass of agreeable coffee - then strolled on to the Englischergarten and looked at the rushing Isar. The light was so delicious as we came back, and the western red at the end of the long vista of the Carlsstrasse was so alluring, that we turned towards that street thinking we would make a little circuit homewards and see the outside of the Basilica. But we saw more than the outside, for one of the doors was open, and we walked in. Very grand it was in the dimness -hardly any colour to be detected by the pale light shed from the line of windows above the bright pillars. We saw a mighty space marked out by long rows of grey columns and a dim arched roof. But we dared not linger lest G. should increase his cold.
"
Germany 1858,1858-04-16,312,337,1858-04-16,"Friday 16. On Wednesday, we walked to the Theresien Wiese to look at the Bavaria by sunset, but a shower came on and drove us to take refuge in a pretty house built near the Ruhmeshalle -whereby we were gainers, for we saw a charming family group: a mother, with her three children; the eldest a boy with his book, the second a three-year old maiden, the third a sweet baby girl of a year and a half; two dogs, one a mixture of the setter and pointer, the other, a turns pit; and a relation, or servant, ironing. The baby cried at the sight of G. in beard and spectacles, but kept turning her eyes towards him from her mother's lap, every now and then seeming to have overcome her fears and then bursting out crying anew. At last, she got down and lifted the table-doth, to peep at his legs, as if to see the monster's nether parts.

"
Germany 1858,1858-04-23,313,338,1858-04-23,"Friday 23. Not being well enough to write, we determined to spend our morning at the Glyptothek and Pinacothek. A glorious morning-all sunshine and blue sky. We went to the Glyptothek first, and delighted ourselves anew with the Sleeping Faun, The Satyr and Bacchus, and the Laughing Faun (Fauna calla macchia). Looked at the two young Satyrs reposing with the pipe in their hands -one of them charming in the boyish good humoured beauty of the face, but both wanting finish in the limbs which look almost as if they could be produced by a turning machine. But the conception of this often-repeated figure is charming: it would make a garden seem more peaceful in the sunshine. Looked at the old Silenus too, which is excellent. I delight in these figures, full of droll animation, flinging some nature in its broad freedom in the eyes of small-mouthed, mincing narrowness. We went into the modern Saal also, glancing on our way at the Cornelius frescoes, which seem to me stiff and hideous. An Adonis by Thorwaldsen is very beautiful.
	Then to the Pinacothek, where we looked at Albert Dürer's portrait again, and many other pictures among which I admired a group by Jordaens: ""A Satyr eating with a peasant shows him that he can blow hot and cold at the same time""; the old grandmother nursing the child, the father with the key in his hand with which he has been amusing baby, looking curiously at the Satyr, the handsome wife still more eager in her curiosity, the quiet cow, the little boy, the dog and cat - all are charmingly conceived.
"
Germany 1858,1858-04-24,313-314,338-339,1858-04-24,"Saturday 24. As we were reading this afternoon Herr Oldenburg came in, invited us to go to his house on Tuesday and chatted pleasantly for an hour. He talked of Kaulbach, whom he has known very intimately, being the publisher of the Reineke Fuchs. The picture of the Hunnen Schlacht was the first of Kaulbach's on a great scale. It created a sensation, and the critics began to call it a ""Weltgeschichtliches Bild"". Since then Kaulbach has been seduced into the complex, wearisome symbolical style, which makes the frescoes at Berlin enormous puzzles.
	When we had just returned from our drive in the Englischergarten, returning by the Sieges-Thor and glancing into the Ludwigskirche for the first time, Bodenstedt pleasantly surprized us by presenting himsel£ We had just heard from Oldenburg that he was very ill. Happily he had recovered and was just returned from Berlin. To our great benefit: for he is a charming man, and promises to be a delightful acquaintance for us in this strange town. He chatted pleasantly with us for half an hour, telling us that he is writing a work in five volumes on the Contemporaries of Shakspeare, and indicating the nature of his criticism of the Shakspearian Drama-which is historical and analytical. Presently he proposed that we should adjourn to his house and have tea with him, and so we turned out altogether in the bright moonlight, and enjoyed his pleasant talk until ten o'clock. His wife is not at home, but we were admitted to see the three sleeping children -  one a baby about a year and a half old, a lovely. waxen thing. He gave the same account ofKaulbach as we had heard from Oldenburg; spoke of Genelli as superior in genius, though he has not the fortune to be recognized; recited some of Hermann Ling's poetry, and spoke enthusiastically of its merits. There was not a word of detraction about any one -  no thing to jar on our impression of him as a refined noble-hearted man.

Germany 1858,1858-04-25,314,339,1858-04-25,"Sunday 25. We walked in the Englischergarten today and looked at the Munich people in their best clothes. Then came home and began to read aloud Bodenstedt's ""Tausend und ein Tag im Morgenland"".
"
Germany 1858,1858-04-26,314,339,1858-04-26,"Monday 26. In the afternoon Professor Andreas Wagner called, a very kind, unpretending old man. He offered to show us his Petrifacten-Sammlung, and promised to introduce us to Professor Martius and his family: also to mention to Bischoff G.'s wish to see him. In the morning Mr. Burton, the English artist called, an agreeable man, with a little English glazing of shyness.
"
Germany 1858,1858-04-27,314,339,1858-04-27,"Tuesday 27. This has been a red-letter day. In the morning, Professor Wagner took us over his Petrifacten-Sammlung, giving us interesting explanations; and before we left him we were joined by Prof. Marti us, an animated clever man, who talked admirably, and invited us to his house. Then we went to Kaulbach's studio, talked with him and saw with especial interest the picture he is preparing as a present to the New Museum. In the evening, after walking in the Theresien Wiese, we went to Herr Oldenburg's, and met Liebig, the chemist, Geibel and Heyse, the poets, and Carriere, the author of a work on the Reformation. Liebig is charming-with well cut features, a low quiet voice, and gentle manners. It was touching to see his hands, the nails black from the roots, the skin all grimed.
	Heyse is like a painter's poet, ideally beautiful; rather brilliant in his talk, and altogether pleasing. Geibel is a man of rather coarse texture, with a voice like a kettle drum, and a steady determination to deliver his opinions on every subject that turned up. But there was a good deal of ability in his remarks. Carriere is a thin-lipped, petty-faced man, whom one wishes out of the room, like a cold draught.
"
Germany 1858,1858-04-28,314,339,1858-04-28,"Wednesday 28. This evening at 7, kind old Professor Wagner came to take us to Martius's, and we spent an interesting evening there. Frau Marti us is a charming woman certainly not less than fifty-five, but with a graceful quiet liveliness and intelligence which makes her more interesting than her daughters.

After calling on Frau Oldenburg, and then at Pro£ Bodenstedt's where we played with his charming children for ten minutes, we went to the theatre to hear Prince Radziwill's music to the Faust. I admired especially the earlier part, the Easter-morning song of the spirits, the Beggar's Song-and other things, until after the scene in Auerbach's cellar, which is set with much humour and fancy. But the scene between Faust and Margaret is bad -  ""Meine Ruh' ist hin"" quite pitiable, and the ""Konig in Thule"" not good. Gretchen's second song, in which she implores help of the ""Schmerzensreiche"" touched me a good deal.

Germany 1858,1858-05-02,315,340,1858-05-02,"Sunday. 2. Still rainy and cold. We went to the Pinacothek and looked at the old pictures in the first and second Saal. There are some very bad and some fine ones by Albert Diirer: of the latter a full-length figure of the Apostle Paul with the head of Mark beside him in a listening attitude is the one that most remains with me. One extremely grotesque by Wohlgemuth, Dürer's master, of Christ risen from the dead and standing something like a propped wooden doll with a frightened expression by the stone grave, the Roman guard ( of two men asleep in the fore-ground), and an angel with the air of a school-girl in the middle distance. Others ofWohlgemuth have much more merit. There is a very striking ""Adoration of the Magi"" by Johannes van Eyck, with much merit in the colouring, perspective and figures. Also ""Christ carrying his Cross"" by Albert Dtirer is striking. ""A woman raised from the dead by the imposition of the Cross"" is a very elaborate composition by Bohme in which the faces are of first rate excellence. In the evening we went to the Opera and saw the ""Nord Stern"".

Letter from Blackwood today, in which he appears to fall in rather with the idea of separate publication for Adam Bede than of publication in the Magazine. We have read Heyse's Novell en after dinner for the last day or two, after laying aside Bodenstedt's ""Tausend und ein Tag im Orient"", which has given us much pleasure in its picture of Mirza Schaffige.

Germany 1858,1858-05-10,315-316,340-341,1858-05-10 (Entry 1),"Monday 10. Since Wednesday I have had a wretched cold and cough, and been otherwise ill; but I have had several pleasures nevertheless. On Friday Bodenstedtcalled with Baron Schack, to take us to Genelli's, the artist, of whose powers B. had spoken to us with enthusiastic admiration. The result to us was nothing but disappointment:-the sketches he showed us seemed to us quite destitute of any striking merit. There were three compositions from Biblical subjects: The banishment from Paradise, The Meeting of Isaac and Rebekah at the Well, and the arrival ofEliphaz with the gifts to Rebekah, who is trying on the bracelet with delight. The rest were mythological; Somnus and the graces Jupiter holding the infant Hercules to the breast of the sleeping Juno, and a pencil sketch of a large picture - Bacchus manifesting himself as a god on board ship after he has been the object of ridicule and insults to the sailors.
	Saturday, the 8th, was a wretched day-snow in the morning, and rain all the rest of the day, so that we only went out to our dinner.
	On Sunday we dined with Liebig, and spent the evening at Bodenstedt's, where we met Professor Bluntschli, the jurist, a very intelligent and agreeable man, and Melchior Meyr, a maker of novels and tragedies, otherwise an ineffectual personage.

A ""Lady with Fruit, followed by three children"", pleased us more than ever. It is by Wickmann. The two interiors of Westminster Abbey by Ainmueller, admirable. Unable to admire Rottmann's Greek landscapes which have a room to themselves. Ditto Kaulbach's ""Zerstörung der Jerusalems"". 
We went for the first time to see the collection of porcelain paintings, and had really a rich treat. Many of them are admirable copies of great pictures. The sweet Madonna and child, Madonna del Tempi in Raphael's early manner; a Holy Family, also in the early manner, with a Madonna the exact type of the St. Catherine; and a Holy Family in the later manner, something like the Madonna della Sedia are all admirably copied. So are two of Andrea del Sarto's - full of tenderness and calm piety.

To Grosshesselohe with a party-vonSiebold and his wife, Prof. Löher, Fräulein von List, Fräulein Thiersch, Frau von Schader and her pretty daughter. It was very pretty to see Von Siebold's delight in nature - the Libellulæ:, the Blindworm, the crimson and black Cicadæ:, the Orchidæ. The strange whim ofSchwanthaler's, the Burg von Schwaneck, was our destination. "

This evening we walked between eight and half past nine in the Wiese looking towards Nymphenburg. The light delicious - the west glowing, the faint crescent moon and Venus pale above it; the larks filling the air with their songs which seemed only a little way above the ground. "

Germany 1858,1858-07-07,319,344,1858-07-07,"Wednesday July 7. This morning we left Munich, setting out in the rain to Rosenheim, by railway. The previous day we dined and sat a few hours with the dear, charming Siebolds, and parted from them with regret-glad to leave Munich, but not to leave the friends who had been so kind to us. For a week before I had been ill-almost a luxury because of the love that tended me. But the general languor and sense of depression produced by Munich air and way of life was no luxury, and I was glad to say a last good bye to the quaint pepper-boxes of the Frauen-Kirche."

Making of GE,[1857]-12-08,291-292,316-317,[1857]-12-08,"Dec. 8 [1857]. A letter from Blackwood today tells us that Major Blackwood during his brother's absence in England, having some reasons, not specified, for being more hopeful about the 'Clerical Scenes', resolved to publish 1000 instead of 750, and in consequence of this Blackwood proposes to pay me an additional £60 when 750 shall have been sold off. He reports that an elderly clergyman has written to him to say that ""Janet's Repentance"" is exquisite-another vote to register along with that of Mrs Nutt's rector, who ""cried over the story like a child."""
Making of GE,[1858]-01-02,292,317,[1858]-01-02,"Jan. 2 [1858]. George has returned this evening from a week's visit at Vernon Hill. On coming upstairs he said, ""I have some very pretty news for you -something in my pocket!"" I was at a loss to conjecture, and thought confusedly of possible opinions from admiring readers, when he drew the ""Times"" from his pocket;-today's number containing a review of the ""Scenes of Clerical Life."" He had happened to ask a gentleman in the railway carriage coming up to London to allow him a look at the ""Times"", and felt quite agitated and tremulous when his eyes alighted on the review. Finding he had time to go into town before the train started, he bought a copy there. It is a highly favourable notice, and as far as it goes, appreciatory.
	When G. went into town he called at Nutt's, and Mrs. Nutt said to him ""I think you don't know our curate. He says the author of Clerical Scenes is a High Churchman; for though Mr. Tryan is said to be Low Church, his feelings and actions are those of a High Churchman"". (The Curate himself being, of course, High C.) There were some pleasant scraps of admiration also gathered for me at Vernon Hill. Doyle happening to mention the treatment of children in the stories, Helps said, ""O, he is a great writer!""
	I wonder how I shall feel about these little details ten years hence, if I am alive. At present I value them as grounds for hoping that my writing may succeed and so give value to my life-as indications that I can touch the hearts of my fellow men, and so sprinkle some precious grain as the result of the long years in which I have been inert and suffering. But at present fear and trembling still predominate over hope.

        I ordered copies to be sent to the following persons: Froude, Dickens, Thackeray, Tennyson, Ruskin, Faraday, ""The author of Companions of my Solitude"", Albert Smith, Mrs. Carlyle."

Making of GE,1858-01-23,294,319,1858-01-23,"Sat. 23rd. There appeared a well-written and enthusiastic article on the book in ""The Statesman"". We hear there was a poor article in the Globe -  of feebly written praise -  the previous week, but beyond this we have not yet heard of any notices from the Press."
Making of GE,1858-01-26,294,319,1858-01-26,"January 26th, came a very pleasant letter from Mrs. Carlyle, thanking the author of Clerical Scenes for the present of his book, praising it very highly, and saying that her husband had promised to read it when released from his mountain of history."
Making of GE,1858-01-30,294,319,1858-01-30,"30th. Received a letter from Faraday, thanking me very gracefully for the present of the 'Scenes'. Blackwood mentions in enclosing this letter, that Simpkin and Marshall have sent for 12 additional copies -the first sign of a move since the subscription. The other night we looked into the Life of Charlotte Bronte to see how long it was before 'Jane Eyre' came into demand at the libraries, and we found that it was not until six weeks after publication. It is just three weeks now since I heard news of the subscription for my book.
"
Making of GE,1858-02-04,294,319,1858-02-04,"Feb. 4. Yesterday brought the discouraging news that though the book is much talked of, it moves very slowly."
Making of GE,1858-02-16,294-295,319-320,1858-02-16,"Feb. 16. Today G. went into the city and saw Langford, for the sake of getting the latest news about our two books-his Sea-Studies having been well launched about a fortnight or ten days ago with a subscription of 8oo. He brought home good news. The Clerical Scenes are moving off at a moderate but steady pace. Langford remarked that while the press had been uniformly favourable, not one critical notice had appeared. G. went to Parker's in the evening, and gathered a little gossip on the subject. Savage, author of the ""Falcon Family"" and now editor of the Examiner, said he was reading the C.S. -had read some of them already in Blackwood, but was now reading the volume; G. Eliot was ""a writer of great merit"". A barrister named Smythe said he had seen ""the bishop"" reading them the other day. As a set-off against this, Mrs. Schlesinger ""couldn't bear the book"". She is a regular novel reader; but hers is the first unfavourable opinion we have heard.
"
Making of GE,1858-02-28,295,320,1858-02-28,"On Sunday, the 28th, Mr. John Blackwood called on us, having come to London for a few days only. He talked a good deal about the ""Clerical Scenes"" and George Eliot, and at last asked, ""Well, am I to see George Eliot this time?"" G. said, ""Do you wish to see him?"""" As he likes - I wish it to be quite spontaneous"". I left the room, and G. following me a moment, I told him he might reveal me. Blackwood was kind, came back when he found he was too late for the train, and said he would come to Richmond again. He came on the following Friday, and chatted very pleasantly-told us Thackeray spoke highly of the ""Scenes"" and said they were not written by a woman. Mrs. Blackwood is sure they are not written by a woman - Mrs. Oliphant, the novelist, too is confident on the same side. I gave Blackwood the MS. of my new novel to the end of the second scene in the wood. He opened it, read the first page, and smiling, said ""This will do"". We walked with him to Kew, and had a good deal of talk. Found, among other things that he had lived two years in Italy when he was a youth, and that he admires Miss Austen.
"
Making of GE,1858-04-03,295,320,1858-04-03,"April 3. Since I wrote those last notes, several encouraging fragments of news about the 'Scenes' have come to my ears -especially that Mrs. Owen Jones and her husband-two very different people-are equally enthusiastic about the book. But both have detected the woman. I lay aside this record today-not to take it up again till we return from Germany in the Autumn.

Making of GE,[1859]-02-06,298-299,323-324,[1859]-02-06,"Feb. 6 [1859]. Yesterday a letter came from Blackwood telling me the result of the subscription for ""Adam Bede"", which was published on the 1st: 730 copies, Mudie having taken 500 on the publishers' terms, i.e. ten per cent on the sale price. At first he had stood out for a larger deduction, and would only take so, but at last he came round. In this letter Blackwood told me the first ab extra opinion of the book, which happened to be precisely what I most desired. A cabinet-maker (brother to B's managing clerk) had read the sheets and declared that the writer must have been ""brought up to the business"", or at least had listened to the workmen in their workshops.
"
Making of GE,1859-02-12,299,324,1859-02-12,"12. Pleasant news from Edinburgh-that Adam Bede was making just the impression Blackwood had anticipated. First agreeable token -a packet from Dr.John Brown containing ""Rab and his Friends"".

Making of GE,1859-03-26,300,325,1859-03-26,"26. George went into town today and brought me home a budget of good news that compensated for the pain I had felt in the coldness of an old friend. Mr. Langford says that Mudie thinks he must have another hundred or two of Adam -  has read the book himself and is delighted with it. Charles Reade says it is ""the finest thing since Shakspeare"" -  placed his finger on Lisbeth's account ofherof her coming home with her husband from their marriage-praises enthusiastically the style-the way in which the author handles the Saxon language. Shirley Brooks also delighted-John Murray says there has never been such a book. Mr Langford says there must be a second edition in 3 vols. and they will print 500: whether Mudie takes more or not they will have sold all by the end of a month. Lucas delighted with the book and will review it in the Times at the first opportunity. ""My soul doth magnify""."
Making of GE,1859-04-17,300,325,1859-04-17,"April 17. I have left off recording the history of Adam Bede, and the pleasant letters and words that come to me-the success has been so triumphantly beyond anything I had dreamed of, that it would be tiresome to put down particulars. Four hundred of the Second Edition ( of 750) sold in the first week, and 21 besides ordered when there was not a copy left in the London house. This morning Hachette has sent to ask my terms for the liberty of translation into French. There was a review in the Times last week which will naturally give a new stimulus to the sale, and yesterday I sent a letter to the Times denying that ""Mr Liggins"" is the author, as the world and Mr. Anders had settled it. But I must trust to the letters I have received and preserved for giving me the history of the book, ifl should live long enough to forget details.
      Shall I ever write another book as true as ""Adam Bede""? The weight of the future presses on me and makes itself felt even more than the deep satisfaction of the past and present.

Italy 1864,1864-05-29,376,401,N/A,"29. Sunday. Went to see the Chapel of the Eremitani painted by Andrea Mantegna. Mantegna's frescoes are the finest things ofhis we have seen but are sadly injured.

Italy 1864,1864-06-09,378,403,N/A,"9. Thursday. To Como. Looked at the beautiful façade of the Cathedral; then
entered to look at the pictures by Luini. Two in distemper, one in oil. Also one
(not good) by Gaudenzio Ferrari. Then to San Fedele: exterior singular and very
old-dating from the tenth century. Then to San Abbondio, a wonderful old
Church built on the site of a still earlier church, which again was built on the site
ofa pagan temple. A handsome young Jesuit, Director of the Seminary to which
the Church belongs was our Cicerone. After dinner we went up the Lake to
Cadenabbia, rain the whole way. In the evening we walked on the terrace and
saw vivid sheet lightning and the fireflies hovering over the lake."
Italy 1864,1864-06-10,378,403,N/A,"10. Friday. Walked along the side of the Lake, the Sommariva way. Then in a boat to Menaggio.

Normany and Brittany,1865-08-10,383,408,N/A,"Aug. 10. 1865. At 20 minutes past 9 on this not too bright but fine morning we
started from home on our expedition to Normandy and Brittany. Happily we
were in good time at the Charing Cross Station, for all London seemed to be bent
in our direction. We had an excellent passage, to Boulogne, where we dined;
then to Noyelles by train . Here we had to wait nearly an hour, the train to St.
Valery not arriving til ¼ to 8. We were rather dismayed to find that we must
stay at St. Valery all night. However, we were tolerably comfortable."
Normany and Brittany,1865-08-11,383,408,N/A,"11th. We had a very agreeable journey by diligence from St. Valery to Dieppe, being fortunate enough to get the coupe. The country was flat and monotonous, but cheerful with cornfields, pastures and green crops, with here and there a group of houses, and the sea in the distance, disclosing itself at some opening in the coast. At Eu, we stayed nearly an hour and walked into the gardens of the Chateau. They are neglected now, and the walks are grass-grown, but we had a pleasant stroll along the avenues of elm and larch. The Chateau is not imposing
but has the quaint picturesqueness which belongs to all the genuine French buildings with their steep roofs and eyelids. The people are rather coarse and German or English-looking. At Dieppe we had time to see the church of St. Jacques; the tower and fa~ade are handsome; the choir very good. From Dieppe to Rouen the journey by railway was delightful, especially the latter part from Monville, where the valley looks as if it realized the paradox ofa happy region of cotton factories.
          We arrived rather late at Rouen and had some disagreeables in getting into the Hotel de France, but at last we were settled comfortably enough and slept
peacefully."
Normany and Brittany,1865-08-12,383-385,408-410,N/A,"12th. We were out early to see the churches which close at 12. In the façade of the Cathedral one tower - the Tour de Beurre so called because paid for with the fines for eating butter in Lent- has a round summit; the other has a steep tiled roof of the French wedge-shaped fashion. In the interior there is some magnificent painted glass, especially in the choir aisles: it is of the 13th century. Here lies or lay the heart of Richard Creur de Lion. It is deposited in the Sacristy at present and is wrapt in a sort of green taffeta enclosed in a leaden case. His body was buried at Fontevrault. St. Maclou has a beautiful exterior in the flamboyant style; one tower towards which the buttresses seem all to converge.
	But the great glory of the old town is the church of St. Ouen. ""The first stone was laid in 1318 by Abbot Jean Roussel, the choir, the chapels and nearly all the transept were completed in 21 years, and the nave and towers finished by the end of the 15th ( 14th?) century."" Above the cross rises the central tower, 260 feet high. The South Portal is called des Marmouzets from the little baboon-like demons who are oozing out below the arch of the doorway etc. Over the door in bas-relief is the Assumption (and below it the death) of the Virgin. The church is 443 feet long and 106 1/2 high. High gallery round the triforium, in nave, choir and transept. The clerestory is very large, and the windows seem to absorb all the solid wall, the roof being maintained in its place by the pillars and buttresses alone. It is beautiful to see the whole interior inverted in the bénitier of black and white marble. The windows are here and there glorious with remnants of painted glass -a range of large figures running round the windows of the choir, looking life size from below.
	""The master mason under and by whom this church was reared is buried in St. Agnes' chapel. His name was Alexander Berneval, and according to tradition, he murdered his apprentice through envy, because the youth had surpassed in the execution of the rose window in the North transept (into the tracery of which the pentalpha is introduced) that which his master had constructed in the South transept. Though the mason paid the penalty of his crime, the monks, out of gratitude for his skill, interred his body within the church."" We saw the tombstone, or rather stones, which are now removed to the chapel of St.Joseph and are placed perpendicularly. The enchased figures supposed to be those of the above-named mason and his pupil, are in the style of drawing of the late 15th century. One is old, one in the prime of life. Both have compasses in their hands, and the elder holds in his left the design for his own rose window in the South. The younger holds, not the design for the pentalpha window, but apparently the plan of a church. (See History of St. Ouen) But by the side of these two figures, on another stone, is a much older piece of work - an enchased figure of an architect holding some instrument before him, and surmounted by elaborate gothic fretwork also enchased: the drawing of this figure is of the 13th century, I should think, or early in the 14th.
	The material used in building St. Ouen is a limestone containing flints, which have been often patiently cut through in the delicate carving and tracery. (St. Ouen was bishop of Rouen and died 678).
	We went up to the inner and outer gallery. From the inner we had a fine view of the interior, with the lights sending dashes of colour across the shafts and mouldings; and we could see the remains of the frescoed angels in the spandrils of the arches in the choir as well as the remains of gilding on the mouldings. From the outer gallery we had a splendid view of the town, with the old houses immediately surrounding the church. On the South the winding Seine where it is finely bridged by some stone arches and divided by woody islets. Above it rises the Mont Ste. Catherine. On the North the tower in which Joan of Arc was imprisoned is discernible below the Mont des Malades. To the right is another eminence called the Bois de Guillaume. A very fine old wooden house is in the rue de la Savonnerie near a grotesque fountain."
Normany and Brittany,,384,409,N/A,
Normany and Brittany,1865-08-13,385,410,N/A,"13th. Sunday. Caen. We made the most unfortunate choice of coming hither by steamer, as far as Honfleur, and thence by rail. Both steamer and railway train were crowded with passengers going to the Cherbourg fetes. However we reached Caen at six, got our dinner and went to bed, worn out by our fatiguing and uncomfortable day."
Normany and Brittany,1865-08-14,385,410,N/A,"14th. Monday. We walked first to St. Pierre, the church with the supremely beautiful tower and spire. In the flower market, which was in the space at the east end, an old woman came up to give her sympathy as we stood admiring the church. It is curious that on one capital alone of the interior the whim of some artist has carved grotesque subjects- Lancelot passing the sea on his sword, Aristotle bestridden and flogged by a woman, a figure riding on an ass etc. - while all the other capitals are in an ordinary style. The great beauty of the tower is chiefly produced by the long lancet windows with the multitudinous lines of their delicate mouldings. Walking along the Rue St. Pierre we saw two very fine old houses, of which the wood work was elaborately carved. One female figure in good preservation was really graceful. Our way took us by St. Sauveur, which has a tower imitated from that of St. Pierre. A tree-lined broad road took us to St.
Etienne, the church of the Abba ye auxHommes founded by William the Conqueror. (A group of workmen in blue blouses of all shades, looked picturesque at a corner of the avenue of poplars on our way). The church remains as it was built in the 11th century as far as the transept: the choir is of later date and pointed. The effect of the West towers is very grand, and the
colour, a fine greenish grey softened by a minute lichen. There is no painted glass. Here William the Conqueror was buried. - ""Tortured by the wound he had received at the cruel sack and burning of Mantes, he repaired to the retired monastery of St. Gervais ( at Rouen) to die. His deathbed was a melancholy example of the vanity ofhuman grandeur. Deserted by his own sons, when the breath was scarce out ofhis body, and plundered by his servants, his body remained stripped and deserted until the pity and charity of an unknown knight in the neighbourhood provided the funds necessary for the burial; and he himself escorted the body to its last resting place in Caen. The funeral was interrupted, even within the precincts of the church, and before the service was concluded by the cry of a man oflow degree who claimed the site of the grave, saying that it occupied the site ofhis father's house, that he had been illegally ejected from it in order to build the church, and he demanded the restitution of his property. The claim, thus boldly made, in the presence of the dead monarch's son Henry, the chief mourner, being backed by the assent of the town's people, who stood by, was not to be denied or rejected, and the bishop was obliged to pay down on the spot 60 sous for a place of burial for the royal corpse. Even then, it is related, that as the coffin was being lowered, it struck against some obstacle and was broken into pieces, so that the corpse fell out and diffused so horrid a stench that the service was hurried to a close"".
         Then we went to the Ste. Trinite, the church of the Abba ye aux Dames, founded by Matilda the wife of the Conqueror in 1066. It is undergoing a thorough repair, but with strict adherence to the original style. The facade has a bas relief in which apparently the Trinity is represented as three human forms, surrounded by the emblems of the evangelists. The interior is very beautiful the Norman style carried out in the choir as well as the nave. The workmen are still busy in the choir which is therefore closed up; but on one side we could see into the transept which appeared to be of a later date than the choir and nave, the main arches being pointed. A beautiful colour was cast on these arches from a window which to us was invisible.
         We sat a long while in the church, waiting till the rain had ceased, and listened to the music of the workmen's hammers, with thoughts of many things in our hearts. In the afternoon we walked out again, saw the Tour aux Gens d'armes and the banks of the river grandly fenced with poplars. Prolonging our walk in search of nothing in particular, we came to a church, where we heard delicious chanting and glorious organ thunder. It was the church of St. John the Baptist, and today is the Fête of the Adoration of the Holy Sacrament. After dinner we went to a Café chantant and heard an excellent basso - Des Louis"
Normany and Brittany,1865-08-[15],386,411,N/A,"14 [15)th. We left Caen at 10 by railway and arrived at Bayeux under a grey sky, the rain already falling in sparse drops as we walked from the station towards the town. The Cathedral is visible from the station rising with its two spires and central tower above the masses of poplars and willows. Walking up to the town we saw a meadow with willows, a stream and cows which reminded me of my glimpse at the neighbourhood of Oxford. The cathedral is very fine, the nave
nearly in the same style as St. Etienne and the Sainte Trini teat Caen, but more elaborately ornamented: the choir exquisite pointed gothic. We went into the crypt and saw the frescoed angels still fresh from the 14th century. After going back to the station to dine at the restaurant, we returned to the Cathedral, saw the procession and heard the mingled music of organ, cannon and military band; having previously seen the Tapestry, now at the Library. It rained furiously when we got into the train which after long delays brought us to St. Lô, the evening star shining upon us."
Normany and Brittany,1865-08-[16],386-387,411-412,N/A,"15 [16)th. We left our comfortable German-looking bedroom at 1/2 past 5, and soon after 6 set off by malle-poste, travelling rapidly through a wooded, fertile, well cultivated country, extremely like the more smiling parts of England, arriving at Vireb y 1/2 past 10. Breakfasted, walked outto see the town, the remains of the old Keep on a precipitous rock, and the winding roads above and below the cloth factories. We were comfortable at our unpretending inn, the Cheval Blanc, and slept well. In the morning rain and sunshine alternated. We had a walk along a fine straight road which showed us the surrounding fruitful and wooded valley. We have seen no old houses-the town is like a Derbyshire town, all stone and slate. We left Vire for Avranches in a most uncomfortable diligence and I was feeling ill all the way; nevertheless I felt the beauty of the smiling bushy country, and was pleased with the neighbourly politeness of the people to each other. Our second conductor said he had driven along that road 25 years and had never had an accident. The road seems to be as direct as the flight of a bird and may be seen making a broad ribbon across the green country for many miles. It is a succession of ups and downs. As soon as we reached Avranches I went to bed ill."
Normany and Brittany,1865-08-18,387,412,N/A,"18. After a good night I was better. The morning was grey and rainy, but cleared off, and we went out to see the points of view, and the town. The country round is lovely- green, bushy, prosperous-looking- and with a bright sun the view must be magnificent; but we had not a bright sun. At the extremity of the town we came upon the yard which attracted us by the picturesqueness of a wall and trough and an old shed-also by a bitch with three pups. Presently the matron, a pleasant looking woman, came out and asked us if we should like to go down into the orchard. We accepted the invitation and found a charming orchard on a slope- the horse and cart standing under a tree and two men sitting by a little pond sorting apples. There are no picturesque old bits in the streets, but we saw a couple ofhead-dresses of old fashion in the market before our hotel windows. When we were caught in the rain on the Esplanade an old English gentleman invited us to enter his house. It is in one of the finest, if there are any equally fine, positions in Avranches, has a nice garden and poultry yard, and a pleasant interior. He pays £16 a year for rent, and with the hire ofhis furniture, taxes etc. his expenses upon it altogether are not more than £30! After this, we walked on and found the Jardin des Plantes, a delightful spot, where there are avenues and grass and some picturesque grey buildings to the right. But the rain was never weary and at last sent us in."
Normany and Brittany,1865-08-19,387-388,412-413,N/A,"19. Saturday. We started by the diligence for Dol, at 1/2 past seven, and though the sky was grey, we had a magnificent drive. The country is what Walter Scott calls the scene from Richmond Hill - a sea of verdure. I never saw anything but that Richmond view at all like it for extent of boskiness. Approaching Dol we had a sight of Mont Dol which is a striking bold height rising suddenly from the plain. The town - the first Breton town we have seen - is really old and picturesque. The houses have a physiognomy; almost every one of them in the principal street has the high dormer window in the centre, like the houses of Nuremberg. They are of black granite with white mortar. We entered a church which has been turned into a market. The men in their blue blouses, the cornsacks and the light entering at the west end made a picture. The Cathedral is of granite (grey not black) and has only one west tower completed; the other is stunted and unfinished. The exterior has a rough majesty. It is in the early pointed style. The finest bit is the liberal southern porch, with an inner double arched doorway contained in a deep receding arch. Pretty walk under the trees with glancing lights, and distant view, round the old fortifications. We left at 3 by railway for St. Malo. The beauty of the country much diminished. At St. Malo we descended from the omnibus at the Hotel de la Paix; and after a 6 o'clock dinner we walked out on the sands just in time to see the sunset over the water, and the black reefs against the western glory. The outline of the town is wonderfully varied and pretty; the sands, the broadest I ever saw, and uninterrupted by wet patches. After this we walked in the town, entered the Cathedral, walked outside the walls again and finished the evening by going to a theatrical performance in a ""barraque"" just outside the gates. M. Pollet ""the English artist"" performing gymnastics, M. Schlax, ""the man-serpent"" really doing wonders in the way of twisting and doubling his body."
Normany and Brittany,1865-08-20,388,413,N/A,20. Delicious walk on the sands - Cathedral and walk again along the pier and the ramparts. Heavy rain in the evening.
Normany and Brittany,1865-08-21,388,413,N/A,21. Monday. A glorious morning walk on the sands. Read Victor Hugo's Petit Roi de Galice. Started at so' clock for Rennes and arrived at the Hotel St.Julien about Sam.
Normany and Brittany,1865-08-22,388,413,N/A,22. Tuesday. From Rennes to Auray.
Normany and Brittany,1865-08-23,388,413,N/A,"23. To Carnac. (Species of fir tree?). Names at Auray: Gubury, Guyonrashi, Seveno. On returning from Carnac we walked out to the Southern end of the town and discovered its beauties."
Normany and Brittany,1865-08-24,388,413,N/A,"24. A brilliant morning. We walked by the water, rested in a summer house, and found out the various promenades of Auray. At 2 o'clock, by the train to Nantes which we reached about 7, putting up atthe Hotel de France."
Normany and Brittany,1865-08-25,388,413,N/A,25. At Nantes again. The Cathedral is old but not beautiful. The church of St. Nicolas looks like a restoration of an old and very beautiful church. I have read through Villemarque's Celtic legends of the cloister - a poor book.
Normany and Brittany,1865-08-26,388,413,N/A,"26. Set off from Nantes at 7 o'clock in the morning. Arrived at Tours at 11. Saw the Cathedral and ascended the Tower. Entered the church of St.Julien, expecting to find it a Remise and Ecurie, but found it completely restored and fitted up for worship. Dined at the Hotel de l'Univers and set off at s for Le Mans, which was so full that we were obliged to put up with a poor bedroom in the second rate Hotel de France. Glimpse of Cafe chantant in the open air."
Normany and Brittany,1865-08-27,388-389,413-414,N/A,"27. After coffee, set off to the Cathedral. Finely placed on an eminence a little above the large Place, near which there are promenades under trees. The Place was covered on one side with a market. Scattered elsewhere about the space were the women in white caps and the men in variously shaded blue blouses.
       The Cathedral took me by surprise from its great mass. It is an immense pile. The west end (exterior) a fine bit of Romanesque or Norman with two original monsters worthy almost of Verona. A Druidic stone in one corner, turning from the west end. A fine porch on the South. Entering, the impression of vastness comes first of all. Then the impression of unsurpassable beauty in the choir, which is of exquisite thirteenth century gothic. The Nave is extremely fine Romanesque. The painted glass is splendid in the choir, and in the Lady Chapel there are remains of fresco on the ceiling and walls. We were sorry that our uncomfortable quarters forced us to leave Le Mans which seems altogether a remarkable and interesting place. We arrived at Chartres at 2 o'clock. It is a fête-day and we were fortunate in getting a fine effect both at Le Mans and at Chartres from the presence of a large congregation and the extra services.
        At Chartres the organ was sublime, and the voices came in fine alternating chant, assisted by a speaking trombone. The painted glass in this Cathedral is transcendent. For the first time I witnessed the supreme effect of light coming thro' painted glass exclusively. The Choir is faulty, and quite offensively degenerates downward into paltry Renaissance stucco work. Beautiful
adornment of the Virgin's altar, and lighting of tapers amongst flowers. Steps into a chapel at East End. The exterior of this Cathedral is the most memorable, after the wondrous glass -the great North and South porches and the portals of the West End. After dinner, the Saltimbanques in the Place-walk to the river Eure - fête- old women on the wall - old turreted gate. Doré pictures in the streets. Mass of the Cathedral by starlight - Place by starlight."
Normany and Brittany,1865-08-28,389,414,N/A,"28. We were so delighted with Chartres that we determined to stay another day. The Gardeners' fête made a special fête for us. We spent the morning till 12 in the Cathedral, where we saw the people with their little children go to kiss some relic- apparently to preserve them from the cholera. There was mass and sublime music. We bought a book about the Cathedral and studied the portals. In the evening we walked out to the old gate again."
Normany and Brittany,1865-08-29,389,414,N/A,"29. Started for Paris, where we arrived at 1/2 past 9, a.m. To the Hotel de France et de Bath, where we got a comfortable apartment. It rained and the streets were very dirty, so that the walks to the Post Office and dinner were not agreeable."
Normany and Brittany,1865-08-30,389,414,N/A,"30. I was not very well, so we were not enterprising. But we went to Mass at the Russian Church - a great enjoyment to me. The bass voice of the officiating priest alternating with the rapid chant of the choir, the sense of being in a church like those of the Byzantine christians ages ago - the grave pictures of the Saints on their golden background - the opening of the doors disclosing the altar, and the figure of Christ seated with uplifted hands all impressed me deeply.

Then we went to the Palais d'Industrie, but saw nothing very exhilarating. In the evening we walked about the Boulevards."
Normany and Brittany,1865-08-31,389,414,N/A,"31. Thursday. I was feeling very poorly, and we did hardly anything but wander and go into the Louvre, where we looked at some of our favourite pictures. In the evening to the Gaïté."
Normany and Brittany,1865-09-01,389,414,N/A,"Sep. 1. Drove in the Bois de Boulogne, and went to the Luxembourg where we saw some new pictures. To bed early, not being well."
Normany and Brittany,1865-09-02,390,415,N/A,"2. Kept quiet during the day, preparing for the Theatre Lyrique in the evening. To our great disappointment we had Rigoletto instead of the Flauto Magico."
Normany and Brittany,1865-09-03,390,415,N/A,"3 Sunday. On arriving at the station for Rouen, we found there was no train at 1 o'clock on Sundays, so we deposited our luggage and spent our hours till 6 very pleasantly at St. Cloud. In the evening at Rouen we had a beautiful sight of the river by moonlight and gas-light. Pillared city under the water."
Normany and Brittany,1865-09-04,390,415,N/A,"4. Spent the day in seeing the Cathedral, the Musée, St. Ouen, and the old streets. Names of the streets - Rue de la Savonnerie, Rue St. Amand, Rue de la Croix de fer."
Normany and Brittany,1865-09-05,390,415,N/A,5. From Rouen to Dieppe.
Normany and Brittany,1865-09-06,390,415,N/A,6. Started at 7 1/2 by diligence for Abbeville. Then from Abbeville to Boulogne.
Normany and Brittany,1865-09-07,390,415,N/A,7. From Boulogne home.
